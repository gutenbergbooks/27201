<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>We are confronted at the present time by the woman who is anxious to lay
by means for her own support irrespective of the protection of her
husband. In this play I have indicated the tendency of this difficulty
and the consequent troubles which the older civilizations will bring
upon themselves when the woman's standing as a worker is generally
acknowledged. My conclusion, namely, that all these complications and
troubles are, at present at any rate, owing to the education of the man,
points to the remedy, as far as I can see it.</p>

<p>I must inform my readers that the version of <span class="smcap">La Femme Seule</span>, a
translation of which is now published in this volume, has, so far, not
appeared in France and is unknown there; at least as regards the larger
part of the third act. I might, did I think it advisable, reproduce in
its entirety a text which certain timidities have led me to emasculate.</p>

<p>As between the man and the woman the ideal situation would, no doubt, be
a rehabilitation of the old custom&mdash;the man at the workshop and the
woman in the home; thus reserving for her the holiest and most important
of all missions&mdash;the one which insures the future of the race by her
enlightened care of the moral and physical health of her children.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it happens that the wages of the working-man are
insufficient for the support of a family, and the poor woman is
therefore compelled to go to the factory. The results are deplorable.
The child is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> either entirely abandoned, or given to the State, and the
solidarity of the family suffers in consequence.</p>

<p>Then again a generation of women with new ideas has arisen, who think
they should have, if they wish it, the right to live alone and by
themselves, without a husband's protection. However much some of us may
regret this attitude, it is one which must be accepted, since I cannot
believe that the worst tyrants would dare to make marriage obligatory.
These women have a right to live, and consequently a right to work. Also
there are the widows and the abandoned women.</p>

<p>Women first took places which seemed best fit for them, and which the
men turned over to them because the work appeared to be of a character
suitable to the feminine sex. But the modern woman has had enough of the
meagre salary which is to be obtained by means of needle-work, and she
has invaded the shop, the office, the desks of the banks and post
office. In industry also she has taken her place by the side of the
working-man, who has made room for her first with ironical grace, then
with grumbling, and sometimes with anger. I believe that in Europe at
least this kind of difficulty will have to be faced in the future.</p>

<p>As to the rich woman (and in <span class="smcap">La Femme Seule</span> I have treated this subject
only slightly because it is one to which I expect to come back), they
have been driven from the home where the progress of domestic science
has left them very little to do. We have reached a kind of hypocritical
form of State Socialism, or perhaps it would be better to say
Collectivism, and this will profoundly change the moral outlook. All, or
nearly all, of the work of the home seems to be done by people from the
outside&mdash;from the cleaning of the windows to the education of the
children. The modern home is but a fireside around which one hardly sees
the family gathered for intimate talk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span></p>

<p>It has thus happened that the woman who finds herself without work, and
with several children, looks out of the windows of her home away from it
for the employment of her activities. The future will tell us whether or
no this is good. In my opinion I believe it will be good, and I believe
that man will gain, through this new intelligence, in the direction of
the larger life which has come to women from this necessity of theirs.
Unquestionably there will have to be a new education, and this will
certainly come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Foi.</span>&mdash;This play is, without doubt, of all my plays the one which has
cost me the most labor and the one upon which I have expended the most
thought and time. The impulse to write it came to me at Lourdes in view
of the excited, suffering, and praying crowds of people. When the
thought of writing it came to me I hesitated, but during many years I
added notes upon notes. And it was while on a trip to Egypt that I saw
the possibility for discussing such questions in the theatre without
giving offence to various consciences. My true and illustrious friend,
Camille Saint-Sa&euml;ns, has been kind enough to underline my prose with his
admirable music. In this way <span class="smcap">La Foi</span> has been produced on the stage at
Monte Carlo for the first time under the auspices of His Royal Highness
the Prince of Monaco, whom I now beg to thank.</p>

<p>English readers of <span class="smcap">La Robe Rouge</span> would, I think, be somewhat misled, if
they did not understand the difference between the procedure in criminal
cases in France and in Great Britain. My purpose in this preface is to
attempt to show that difference in a few words.</p>

<p>With you, a criminal trial is conducted publicly and before a jury; with
us in France it is carried on in the Chambers of the Judge with only the
lawyer present. There sometimes result from this latter method dramas of
the kind of which my play <span class="smcap">La Robe Rouge</span> is one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> The judge, too directly
interested and free of the criticism which might fall on him from the
general public, is liable to the danger of forming for himself an
opinion as to the guilt of the accused. He may do this in perfect good
faith, but sometimes runs the risk of falling into grave error. It thus
occasionally happens that he is anxious not so much to know the truth as
to prove that he was right in his own, often rash, opinion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Robe Rouge</span> is a criticism of certain judicial proceedings which
obtain in France; but it is also a study of an individual case of
professional crookedness. We should be greatly mistaken were we to draw
the dangerous conclusion that all French judges resemble Mouzon, and we
should be equally wrong were we to condemn too hastily the French code
relating to criminal trials.</p>

<p>In the struggle of society with the criminal it is very difficult,
perhaps impossible, for the legislator to hold in equal balance the
rights of the individual as against the interests of society. The
balance sometimes leans one way and sometimes the other; and had I been
an English citizen, instead of writing a play against the abuse of
justice by a judge, I might have had to illustrate the same abuse by the
lawyer.</p>

<p>I wish most sincerely that these three plays may interest the people of
England and America. The problems which I have studied I am sure I have
not brought to their final solutions. My ambition was to draw and keep
the attention of honest people on them by means of the theatre.</p>

<h2>ACT I</h2>


<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Scene:</span>&mdash;<i>A Louis XV sitting-room. To the right a large recessed window
with small panes of glass which forms a partition dividing the
sitting-room from an inner room. A heavy curtain on the further side
shuts out this other room. There are a table and piano and doors to the
right and at the back. The place is in disorder. One of the panes in the
large window has been taken out and replaced by a movable panel. It is
October.</i></p>

<p><i>Madame Gu&eacute;ret is sitting at a table. She is a woman of forty-five,
dressed for the afternoon, cold and distinguished looking. Monsieur
Gu&eacute;ret, who is with her, is about fifty-five and is wearing a frock
coat. He is standing beside his wife.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Then you really don't want me to go and hear the third act?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret</span> [<i>dryly</i>] I think as I've been let in for these
theatricals solely to please your goddaughter you may very well keep me
company. Besides, my brother is coming back and he has something to say
to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret</span> [<i>resignedly</i>] Very well, my dear.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>A pause.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> I can't get over it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Over what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> What we're doing. What <i>are</i> we doing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> We're giving a performance of <i>Barberine</i> for the amusement of
our friends. There's nothing very extraordinary in that.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Don't make fun of me, please. What we are doing is simply
madness. Madness, do you hear? And it was the day before yesterday&mdash;only
the day before yesterday&mdash;we heard the news.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> We&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret</span> [<i>Who has seen Lucienne come in</i>] Hush!</p>

<p><i>Lucienne comes in, a girl of twenty, dressed as Barberine from Musset's
play; then Maud, Nadia, and Antoinette [eighteen to twenty-two], dressed
as followers of the queen. Lucienne goes to the piano, takes a piece of
music, and comes to Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> You'll help me along, won't you, dear Madame Gu&eacute;ret? You'll
give me my note when it comes to "Voyez vous pas que la nuit est
profonde"?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Now don't be nervous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maud</span> [<i>coming in</i>] We're ready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Antoinette.</span> If the third act only goes as well as the first two&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maud.</span> We'll listen until we have to go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Antoinette.</span> Won't you come with us, Madame?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> No, I can't. I've had to undertake the noises behind the
scenes. <i>That</i> job might have been given to someone else, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Oh, Madame, please don't be angry with us. Madame Chain let us
know too late. And you're helping us so much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Well, I've invited the people, and I suppose I must
entertain them. As I gave in to Th&eacute;r&egrave;se about getting up this play, I
don't want to do anything to spoil the evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> How pretty she is as Kalekairi.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> You don't think people are shocked by her frock?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Oh, Madame!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Well!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> I shall have to go in a moment. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se has come out; I can
hear her sequins rattling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Yes; so can I. But Ren&eacute; will let us know. Never mind.</p>

<p><i>She goes to the piano. Ren&eacute; appears at the door at the back.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Are you ready, Lucienne?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> You've only two lines to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Only one. [<i>She speaks low to Ren&eacute;</i>] No end of a success,
wasn't it, for your Th&eacute;r&egrave;se?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;</span> [<i>low</i>] Wasn't it? I <i>am</i> so happy, Lucienne. I love her so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Listen. That's for me, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Yes, that's for you. Wait. [<i>He goes to the door at the back,
listens, and returns</i>] Come. Turn this way so as to make it sound as if
you were at a distance. Now then.</p>

<p><i>Lucienne places her music on the piano with a smile to Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;</span> [<i>to Lucienne, drawing her to the partition window and showing her
where a pane has been removed</i>] And your little window! Have you seen
your little window? It was not there at the dress rehearsal. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> lift
it like this. It's supposed to be an opening in the wall. It ought to
have been different; we were obliged to take out a pane. May I show her,
Madame Gu&eacute;ret?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret</span> [<i>resigned</i>] Yes, yes, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> You lift it like this; and to speak you'll lean forward, won't
you, so that they may see you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> I will, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Don't touch it now. [<i>To Madame Gu&eacute;ret</i>] You won't forget the
bell, will you, Madame? There's plenty of time&mdash;ten minutes at least.
I'll let you know. Mademoiselle Lucienne, now, time to go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Yes, yes. [<i>She goes out</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret</span> [<i>with a sigh</i>] To have a play being acted in the
circumstances we're in&mdash;it's beyond everything! I cannot think how I
came to allow it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> You see they'd been rehearsing for a week. And Th&eacute;r&egrave;se&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> And I not only allowed it, but I'm almost taking part in
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> We couldn't put off all these people at twenty-four hours'
notice. And it's our last party. It's really a farewell party. Besides,
we should have had to tell Th&eacute;r&egrave;se everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Well, you asked me to keep it all from her until
to-morrow&mdash;though it concerns her as much as it does us. [<i>Monsieur
F&eacute;liat comes in, a man of sixty, correct without being elegant</i>] Here's
my brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> I've something to tell you. Shall we be interrupted?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Yes, constantly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Let's go into another room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> I can't. And all the rooms are full of people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Marguerite has been good enough to help here by taking the place
of Madame Chain, who's ill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret</span> [<i>angrily</i>] Yes, I've got to do the noises heard off! At
my age! [<i>A sigh</i>] Tell us, Etienne, what is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> We can wait until the play is over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> So like you! You don't care a bit about what my brother
has to tell us. Who'd ever believe this is all your fault! [<i>To her
brother</i>] What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> I have seen the lawyer. Your goddaughter will have to sign this
power of attorney so that it may get to Lyons to-morrow morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret</span> [<i>who has glanced at the paper</i>] But we can't get her to sign
that without telling her all about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Well, goodness me, she'll have to know sometime! I must
say I cannot understand the way you've kept this dreadful thing from
her. It's pure sentimentality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> The poor child!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> You really are ridiculous. One would think that it was
only <i>her</i> money the lawyer took. It's gone, of course; but so is ours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> We still have La Tremblaye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Yes, thank goodness, because La Tremblaye belongs to me.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Ren&eacute; comes in in great excitement.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Where is Mademoiselle Th&eacute;r&egrave;se? She'll keep the stage waiting!

[<i>To Madame Gu&eacute;ret</i>] Above all, Madame, don't forget the bell, almost
the moment that Mademoiselle Th&eacute;r&egrave;se comes off the stage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Yes, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> And my properties! [<i>He runs out</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> You've quite made up your minds to come to Evreux?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Quite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Are you sure you won't regret Paris?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Oh, no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> For the last two years I've hated Paris.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Since you began to play cards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> For the last two years we've had the greatest difficulty in
keeping up appearances. This lawyer absconding is the last blow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Aren't you afraid you will be horribly bored at La Tremblaye?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret</span> [<i>rising</i>] What are we to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Well, now listen to me. I told you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ren&eacute; comes in and takes something off a table. F&eacute;liat stops suddenly.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Good-morning, uncle. [<i>He hurries out</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Good-morning, Ren&eacute;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> He knows nothing about it yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> No; and my sister-in-law asked me to tell him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Well, why shouldn't you? If they <i>are</i> engaged, we know
nothing about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> We know nothing officially, because in these days young
people don't condescend to consult their parents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Ren&eacute; told his people and they gave their consent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Unwillingly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Oh certainly, unwillingly. Then I'm to tell him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> The sooner the better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> I'll tell him to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> I'm afraid it'll be an awful blow to the poor chap.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Oh, he's young. He'll get over it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> What was I saying when he came in? Ah, yes; you know I've
decided to add a bindery to my printing works at Evreux; you saw the
building started when you were down there. If things go as I want them
to, I shall try to do some cheap artistic binding. I want to get hold of
a man who won't rob me to manage this new branch and look after it; a
man who won't be too set in his ideas, because I want him to adopt mine;
and, at the same time, I'd like him to be not altogether a stranger. I
thought I'd found him; but I saw the man yesterday and I don't like him.
Now will <i>you</i> take on the job? Would it suit you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Would it suit me! Oh, my dear F&eacute;liat, how can I possibly thank
you? To tell you the truth, I've been wondering what in the world I
should do with myself now; and I was dreading the future. What you offer
me is better than anything I could have dreamt of. What do you say,
Marguerite?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> I am delighted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Then that's all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret</span> [<i>to his brother-in-law</i>] I think you won't regret having
confidence in me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> And your goddaughter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Th&eacute;r&egrave;se?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Yes; how is <i>she</i> going to face this double news of her ruin and
the breaking off of her engagement?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> I think she ought to have sense enough to understand that
one is the consequence of the other. She can hardly expect Ren&eacute;'s
parents to give their son to a girl without money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> I suppose not. But what's to become of her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> She will live with us, of course.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> "Of course"! I like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> She has no other relations, and her father left her in my care.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> He left her in <i>your</i> care, and it's <i>I</i> who have been
rushed into all the trouble of a child who is nothing to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Child! She was nineteen when her father died.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> To look after a young girl of nineteen is a very great
responsibility.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret</span> [<i>laughing bitterly</i>] Ho! Ho! Look after! Look after
Mademoiselle Th&eacute;r&egrave;se! You think she's a person who allows herself to be
looked after! And yet you've seen her more or less every holidays.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> You've not had to look after her; she has been at the Lyc&eacute;e.</p>

<p><i>Th&eacute;r&egrave;se comes in dressed as Kalekairi from "Barberine." She is a pretty
girl of twenty-three, healthy, and bright.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> The bell, the bell, godmother! You're forgetting the bell!
Good-evening, Monsieur F&eacute;liat.</p>

<p><i>Th&eacute;r&egrave;se takes up the bell, which is on the table.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> I was going to forget it! Oh, what a nuisance! All this
is so new to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Excuse me! I really didn't recognize you for the moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>laughing</i>] Ah, my dress. Startling, isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret</span> [<i>with meaning</i>] Startling is the right word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;</span> [<i>appearing at the back, disappearing again immediately, and
calling</i>] The bell! And you, on the stage, Mademoiselle Th&eacute;r&egrave;se!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I'm coming. [<i>She rings</i>] Here I am!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>She goes out.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret</span> [<i>with a sigh</i>] And I had it let down!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Her dress. [<i>To her husband</i>] What I see most clearly in
all this is that she must stay with us.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Ren&eacute; comes fussing in.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Where's the queen? Where's Madame N&eacute;risse?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> I've not seen her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> But goodness gracious&mdash;! [<i>He goes to the door on the left and
calls</i>] Madame N&eacute;risse!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse</span> [<i>from outside</i>] Yes, yes, I'm ready.</p>

<p><i>Madame N&eacute;risse comes in. She is about forty, flighty, and a little
affected.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> I wanted to warn you that Ulric will be on your right, and if he
plays the fool&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Very well. Is it time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Yes, come. [<i>To Madame Gu&eacute;ret</i>] You won't forget the trumpets?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> No, no. All the same, you'd better help me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> I will, I will.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>He goes out with Madame N&eacute;risse.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> You know, if she wants one, she'll find a husband at Evreux.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Without a penny!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Without a penny! She made a sensation at the ball at the
sous-pr&eacute;fecture. She's extremely pretty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> She's young.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Monsieur Gambard sounded me about her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Monsieur Gambard! The Monsieur Gambard who has the house
with the big garden?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Yes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> But he's very rich.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> He's forty-nine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> She'll have to take what she can get now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> And I think that Monsieur Beaudoin&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> But he's almost a cripple!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> She wouldn't do so well in Paris.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> She wouldn't look at either of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> We must try and make her see reason.</p>

<p><i>Ren&eacute; enters busily. Lucienne follows him. F&eacute;liat is standing across the
guichet through which Barberine is to speak. Ren&eacute; pulls him away without
ceremony.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Excuse me, Uncle; don't stand there before the little window.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Beg pardon. I didn't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> I haven't a moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> I've never seen you so busy. At your office they say you're a
lazy dog.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Probably Ren&eacute; has more taste for the stage than for
business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;</span> [<i>laughing</i>] Rather! [<i>To Lucienne</i>] Now, it's time. Come. Lift it.
Not yet! There! <i>Now!</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne</span> [<i>speaking through the guichet</i>] "If you want food and drink,
you must do like those old women you despise&mdash;you must spin."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Capital!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne</span> [<i>to F&eacute;liat</i>] Please forgive me, Monsieur, I've not had time to
speak to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Why, it's Mademoiselle Lucienne, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se's friend, who came and
stayed in the holidays! Fancy my not recognizing you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> It's my dress. I <i>do</i> like playing this part. I have to say
that lovely bit&mdash;you know&mdash;the bit that describes the day of the ideal
wife. [<i>She recites, sentimentally</i>] "I rise and go to prayers, to the
farmyard, to the kitchen. I prepare your meal; I go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> with you to church;
I read a page or two; I sew a while; and then I fall asleep happy upon
your breast."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> That's good, oh, that's very good! <i>Barberine</i>&mdash;now, who wrote
that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Alfred de Musset.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Ah, yes; to be sure, Alfred de Musset. I read him when I was
young. You often find his works lying about in pretty bindings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Uncle, Uncle; I beg your pardon, but don't speak so loud. We can
hardly hear what they're saying on the stage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat</span> [<i>very politely</i>] Sorry, I'm sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;</span> [<i>to Lucienne</i>] You. <i>Now.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne</span> [<i>speaking through the guichet</i>] "My lord, these cries are
useless. It grows late. If you wish to sup&mdash;you must spin." [<i>turning to
the others</i>] There! Now I must go over the rest with Ulric.</p>

<p><i>She runs out, with a little wave of adieu to F&eacute;liat.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;</span> [<i>to Madame Gu&eacute;ret</i>] The trumpets, Madame. Don't forget.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> No, no. Don't worry.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Ren&eacute; goes out.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> You blow trumpets?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Yes; on the piano.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> I don't know what to do with myself. I don't want to be in the
way. I'm not accustomed to being behind the scenes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Nor am I.</p>

<p><i>Th&eacute;r&egrave;se comes in in the Kalekairi dress, followed by Ren&eacute;.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> It's time for me now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat</span> [<i>to Madame Gu&eacute;ret</i>] She really looks like a professional
actress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;</span> [<i>to Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</i>] Now!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>speaking through the little window</i>] "My lady says, as you
will not spin, you cannot sup. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> thinks you are not hungry, and I
wish you good-night." [<i>She closes the little window and says gayly</i>]
Good-evening, Monsieur F&eacute;liat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Now then, come along. You go on in one minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>to F&eacute;liat</i>] I'll come back soon.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>She goes out.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;</span> [<i>to Madame Gu&eacute;ret</i>] Now, Madame, <i>you</i>, Quick, Madame!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Yes, yes. All right.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>She plays a flourish of trumpets on the piano.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Splendid!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Ouf! It's over. At last we can have peace! If she's such
a fool as to refuse both these men&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret</span> [<i>interrupting</i>] She won't refuse, you may be sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret</span> [<i>continuing</i>]&mdash;we shall have to keep her with us. But I
shall insist upon certain conditions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> What conditions?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> I won't have any scandals at Evreux.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> There won't be any scandals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> No; because she'll have to behave very differently, I can
tell you. She'll have to leave all these fine airs of independence
behind her in Paris.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> What airs?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Well, for instance, getting letters and answering them
without any sort of supervision! [<i>To her brother</i>] She manages in such
a way that I don't even see the envelopes! [<i>To her husband</i>] I object
very much, too, to her student ways.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> She goes to classes and lectures with her girl friends.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Well, she won't go to any more. And she will have to give
up going out alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> She's of age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> A properly brought up young lady is never of age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Perfectly true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> And there must be a change in her way of dressing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> There will. She'll have to dress simply, for she won't have a
rap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> That has nothing to do with it. I shall make her
understand that she will have to behave like the other girls in good
society.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> I shall also put a veto on certain books she reads. [<i>To
her brother</i>] It's really dreadful, Etienne. You've no idea! One day I
found a shocking book upon her table&mdash;a horror! What do you suppose she
said when I remonstrated? That that disgraceful book was necessary in
preparing for her examination. And the worst of it is, it was true. She
showed me the syllabus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> I'm afraid they're bringing up our girls in a way that'll make
unhappy women of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Don't let's talk about it; you'll start on politics, and
then you and Henri will begin to argue. All the same I mean to be very
good to her. As soon as she knows what's happened her poor little
pretensions will come tumbling about her ears. I won't leave her in
uncertainty, and even before she asks I'll tell her she may stay with
us; but I shall tell her, too, what I expect from her in return.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Wouldn't it be better&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> My dear, I shall go my own way. See what we're suffering
now in consequence of going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> <i>yours</i>. Here's Madame N&eacute;risse. Then the
play is over. [<i>To her husband</i>] You must go and look after the people
at the supper table. I'll join you in a minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> All right.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>He goes out.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> I've hardly ever been at such a successful party. I
wanted to congratulate dear Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, but she's gone to change her dress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret</span> [<i>absently</i>] So glad. Were you speaking of having a notice
of it in your paper?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Of your play! If I was going to notice it! I should
think so! The photographs we had taken at the dress rehearsal are being
developed. We shall have a wonderful description.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret</span> [<i>imploring</i>] Could it be stopped?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> It's not possible! Just think how amazed the subscribers
to <i>Feminine Art</i> would be if they found nothing in their paper about
your lovely performance of <i>Barberine</i>, even if the editress of the
paper hadn't taken a part in the play. If it only depended on me,
perhaps I could find some way out&mdash;explain it in some way, just to
please you. But then there's your charming Th&eacute;r&egrave;se&mdash;one of our
contributors. I can't tell you what a wonderful success she's had with
her two stories, illustrated by herself. People adore her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Nobody would know anything about it&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Nobody know! There are at least ten people among your
guests who will send descriptions of this party to the biggest morning
papers, simply for the sake of getting their own names into print. If
<i>Feminine Art</i> had nothing about it, it would be thought extremely odd,
I assure you. [<i>She turns to F&eacute;liat</i>] Wouldn't it, Monsieur?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Pardon me, Madame, I know nothing about these things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Well, we'll say no more about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> But what's the matter? You must have some very good
reason for not wanting me to put in anything about your delightful
party.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> No&mdash;&mdash;only&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Hesitating</i>] Some of our family are
country people, you know. It would take me too long to explain it all to
you. It doesn't matter. [<i>With a change of tone</i>] Then honestly you
think Th&eacute;r&egrave;se has some little talent?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Little talent! No, but very great talent. Haven't you
read her two articles?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Oh, I? I belong to another century. In my days it would
have been considered a very curious thing if a young girl wrote novels.
My brother feels this too. By the way, I have not introduced my brother
to you. Monsieur F&eacute;liat, of Evreux&mdash;Madame N&eacute;risse, editress of
<i>Feminine Art</i>. Madame N&eacute;risse has been kind enough to help us with our
little party. [<i>To Madame N&eacute;risse</i>] Yes&mdash;you were speaking about&mdash;what
was it&mdash;this story that Th&eacute;r&egrave;se has written. No doubt your readers were
indulgent to the work of a little amateur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> I wish I could find professionals who'd do half as well.
I'm perfectly certain the number her photograph is going to be in will
have a good sale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> You'll publish her photograph?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> In her dress as Kalekairi.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> In her dress as Kalekairi!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> On the front page. They tell me it's a first-rate
likeness. I'll bring you one of them before long, and your country
relations will be delighted. If you'll excuse me, I'll hurry away and
change my dress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Oh, please excuse me for keeping you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Good-bye for the present. [<i>She goes to the door</i>] I was
looking for Maud and Nadia to take them away with me. I see them over
there having a little flirtation. [<i>She looks through the door and
speaks pleasantly to Maud and Nadia, who are just outside</i>] All right,
all right; I won't interrupt. [<i>To Madame Gu&eacute;ret</i>] They'd much rather
come home alone. Good-bye. [<i>She bows to F&eacute;liat</i>] Good-bye, Monsieur.
[<i>Turning again to Madame Gu&eacute;ret</i>] Don't look so upset because you have
a goddaughter who can be a great writer or a great painter if she
chooses; just as she would have been a great actress if she had taken a
fancy for that. Good-bye again and many congratulations.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>She goes out.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Well! Anyway, she's not <i>my</i> daughter! I must go and say
good-bye to everybody. When I've got rid of them, I'll come back and see
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se. Will you wait for me? You'll find some papers on that little
table. Oh, goodness, what times we live in!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Madame Gu&eacute;ret goes out. F&eacute;liat, left alone, strolls to the
door and looks in the direction in which Madame N&eacute;risse had
seen Maud and Nadia. After a moment he shows signs of
indignation.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat</span> [<i>shocked</i>] Oh, I say, this is really&mdash;I must cough or something,
and let them know I'm here. [<i>He coughs</i>] They've seen me. They're
waving their hands&mdash;and&mdash;they 're going on just the same!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Lucienne and Th&eacute;r&egrave;se in ordinary dress come in and notice
what F&eacute;liat is doing.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>to Lucienne</i>] What is he doing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> What's the matter?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>They advance to see what has caused his perturbation. He
hears them and turns.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> It is incredible!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You seem rather upset. What's the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> What's the matter? Those girls are behaving in such a scandalous
way with those young men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Let's see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Oh, don't look! [<i>Suddenly stopping, half to himself</i>] Though I
must say&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>laughing</i>] What must you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> I know. You mean that we're just as bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> No, no, not as bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Yes, yes; well&mdash;almost. [<i>F&eacute;liat makes a sign of protest</i>] I
saw you watching us yesterday after the rehearsal! You saw I was
flirting, and I know you imagined all sorts of horrid things. Our little
flirtations are not what you think. When we flirt we play at love-making
with our best boys, just as once upon a time we played at mothering with
our dolls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> But that doesn't justify&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You don't understand. People spoil us while we're children, and
then look after us so tremendously carefully when we grow up that we
guess there must be delightful and dangerous possibilities about us.
Flirting is our way of feeling for these possibilities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> We're sharpening our weapons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> But the foils have buttons on them, and the pistols are only
loaded with powder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> And it's extremely amusing and does no harm to anybody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Monsieur F&eacute;liat, you've read bad books. Nowadays girls like us
are neither bread-and-butter misses nor demi-vierges. We're perfectly
respectable young people. Quite capable and self-possessed and, at the
same time, quite straight and very happy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> I'm perfectly sure of it, my dear young ladies. But you know
I've had a great deal of experience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Oh, <i>experience</i>! Well, you know&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Oh, <i>experience</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You say you have experience; that only means you know about the
past better than we do. But we know much better than you do about the
present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> I think those girls there are playing a dangerous game.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You needn't have the smallest anxiety about them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> That way of going on might get them into great trouble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> It won't, I assure you. Monsieur F&eacute;liat, believe me, you know
nothing about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> We're clever enough to be able to take care of ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> But there are certain things that take you by storm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Not us. Flirting is an amusement, a distraction, a game.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Shall we say a safety valve?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> There's not a single one of us who doesn't understand the
importance of running straight. And, to do them justice, these boys have
no idea of tempting us to do anything else. What they want, what we all
really want, is a quite conventional, satisfactory marriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> I most heartily approve; but in my days so much wisdom didn't
usually come from such fascinating little mouths.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Now how can you blame us when you see that really we think
exactly as you do yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> In my days girls went neither to the Lyc&eacute;e<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> nor to have
gymnastic lessons, and they were none the less straight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne</span> [<i>reflectively</i>] And yet they grew up into the women of to-day.
I get educated and try to keep myself healthy, with exercises and
things, because I want to develop morally and physically, and be fit to
marry a man a little bit out of the ordinary either in fortune or
brains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You see our whole lives depend upon the man we marry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> I seem to have heard that before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Yes; so've I. But it's none the less true for that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Isn't it funny that we seem to be saying the most shocking
things when we're only repeating what our grandfathers and grandmothers
preached to their children?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> They were quite right. Love doesn't make happiness by itself.
One has to consider the future. We do consider it; in fact we do nothing
else but consider it. We want to get the best position for ourselves in
the future that we possibly can. We're not giddy little fools, and we're
not selfish egotists. We want our children to grow up happy and capable
as we've done ourselves. We're really quite reasonable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat</span> [<i>hardly able to contain himself</i>] You are; indeed you are. It
makes one shudder. Excuse me, I'm going to supper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Let's all go together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Thanks, I can find my way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> It's down that passage to the right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Yes, I shall find it, thank you.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>He goes out.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You shocked the poor old boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> I only flavored the truth just enough to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> make it tasty. But
I've something frightfully important to tell you. It's settled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> What's settled?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> I'm engaged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You don't say so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> It's done. Armand has been to his people and they've come to
see mine. So I needn't play any more piano, nor sing any more
sentimental songs; I needn't be clever any more, nor flirt any more, nor
languish at young men any more. And how do you suppose it was settled?
Just what one wouldn't have ever expected. You know my people were doing
all they could to dress me up, and show me off, and seem to be richer
than they are, so as to attract the men. On my side I was giving myself
the smartest of airs and pretending to despise money and to think of
nothing but making a splash. Everything went quite differently from what
I expected. I wanted to attract Armand, and I was only frightening him
off. He thought such a woman as I was pretending to be too expensive. It
was just through a chance conversation, some sudden confidence on my
part, that he found out that I really like quite simple things. He was
delighted, and he proposed at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Dear Lucienne, I'm so glad. I hope you'll be very, very happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Ah, that's another story. Armand is not by any means perfect.
But what can one do? The important thing is to marry, isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Of course. Well, if your engagement is on, mine's off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Th&eacute;r&egrave;se! Why I've just been talking to Ren&eacute;. I never saw him
so happy, nor so much in love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> He doesn't know yet. Or perhaps they're telling him now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Telling him what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I've lost all my money, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Lost all your money!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes. The lawyer who had my securities has gone off with them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> When?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I heard about it the day before yesterday. Godpapa and godmamma
were so awfully good they never said anything to me about it, though
they're losing a lot of money too. They thought I hadn't heard, and I
expect they wanted me to have this last evening's fun. I said nothing,
and so nobody knows anything except you, now, and probably Ren&eacute;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> What will you do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> What can I do? It's impossible for him to marry me without a
penny. Of course I shall release him from his promise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> You think he'll give you up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> His people will make him. If they cut off his allowance, he'll
be at their mercy. He earns about twenty dollars a month in that
lawyer's office. So, you see&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Oh! poor Th&eacute;r&egrave;se! And you could play Barberine with a secret
like that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>sadly</i>] I've had a real bad time since I heard. It's awful at
night!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> My dearest! And you love him so!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>much moved</i>] Yes&mdash;oh! don't make me cry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> It might do you good!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You know&mdash;[<i>She breaks down a little</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne</span> [<i>tenderly</i>] Yes&mdash;I know that you're good and brave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I shall have to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Then you'll break off the engagement?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes. I shall never see him again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Never see him again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I shall write to him. If I saw him I should probably break
down. If I write I shall be more likely to be able to make him feel that
we must resign ourselves to the inevitable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> He'll be horribly unhappy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> So shall I. [<i>Low and urgently</i>] Oh, if he only understood me!
If he was able to believe that I can earn my own living and that he
could earn his. If he would dare to do without his people's consent!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Persuade him to!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> It's quite impossible. His people are rich. Only just think
what they'd suspect me of. No; I shall tell him all the things his
father will tell him. But oh! Lucienne, if he had an answer for them! If
he had an answer! [<i>She cries a little</i>] But, my poor Ren&eacute;, he won't
make any stand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> How you love him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Oh, yes; I love him. He's rather weak, but he's so loyal and
good and [<i>in a very low voice</i>] loving.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Oh, my dear, I do pity you so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I am to be pitied, really. [<i>Pulling herself together</i>] There's
one thing. I shall take advantage of this business to separate from
godpapa and godmamma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> But you have no money&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I've not been any too happy here. You know they're&mdash;[<i>She sees
Madame Gu&eacute;ret and whispers to Lucienne</i>] Go now. I'll tell you all about
it to-morrow. [<i>Louder and gayly</i>] Well, good-night, my dear. See you
to-morrow at the Palais de Glace or at the Sorbonne! Good-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Good-night, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>She goes out.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret</span> [<i>speaking through the door</i>] Yes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> she's here. Come in.
[<i>Gu&eacute;ret and F&eacute;liat come in</i>] Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, we have something to say to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes, godmamma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> It's about something important; something very serious.
Let us sit down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> You'll have to be brave, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> We are ruined, and you are ruined too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Is that all you have to say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I knew it already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> You <i>knew</i> it? Who told you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> The lawyer told me himself. I had a long letter from him
yesterday. He begs me to forgive him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Well, I declare!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I'll show it to you. He's been gambling. To get a bigger
fortune for his girls, he says.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> You <i>knew</i> it! And you've had the strength,
the&mdash;duplicity?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>smiling</i>] Just as you had yourself, godmamma. And I'm so much
obliged to both of you for saying nothing to me, because I'm sure you
wanted me to have my play to-night and enjoy myself; and that was why
you tried to keep the news from me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> And you were able to laugh and to <i>act</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I've always tried to keep myself in hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Oh, I know. All the same&mdash;And I was so careful about
breaking this news to you, and you knew it all the time!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I'm very sorry. But you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> All right, all right. Well, then, we have nothing to
tell. But do you understand that you've not a penny left?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> You're to go on living with us, of course.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret</span> [<i>to her husband</i>] You really might have given her time to
ask us. [<i>To Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</i>] We take it that you have asked us, and we answer
that we will keep you with us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> We are going to Evreux. My brother-in-law is giving me work in
his factory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> We will keep you with us, but on certain conditions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Thank you very much, godmamma, but I mean to stay in Paris.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> You don't understand. We are going to live at Evreux.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> But <i>I</i> am going to live in Paris.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Then it is I who do not understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> All the same&mdash;[<i>A silence</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> I can hardly believe that you propose to live in Paris by
yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>simply</i>] I do, godmamma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Alone!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Alone! I repeat, I don't understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Nor do I. But no doubt you have reasons to give to your
godfather and godmother. [<i>He moves to go</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> There's no secret about my reasons. All the world may know
them. When I've explained you'll see that it's all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> I must confess to being extremely curious to hear these
reasons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I do hope my decision won't make you angry with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Angry! When have I ever been angry with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>protesting</i>] You've both been&mdash;you've all three been&mdash;<i>most</i>
good and kind to me, and I shall always remember it and be grateful. You
may be sure I shan't love you any the less because I shall live in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Paris and you at Evreux. And I do beg of you to feel the same to me. I
shall never forget what I owe to you. Father was only your friend; we're
not related in any way: but you took me in, and for four years you've
treated me as if I was your daughter. From my very heart I'm grateful to
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret</span> [<i>affectionately</i>] You don't owe us much, you know. For two years
you were a boarder at the Lyc&eacute;e Maintenon, and we saw nothing of you but
your letters. You've only actually lived with us for two years, and
you've been like sunshine in the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Yes, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I've thought this carefully over. I'm twenty-three. I won't be
a burden to you any longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Is that because you are too proud and independent?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> If I thought I could really be of use to you, I would stay with
you. If I could help you to face your troubles, I would stay with you.
But I can't, and I mean to shift for myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> And you think you can "shift for yourself," as you call
it, all alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes, godmamma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> A young girl, all alone, in Paris! The thing is
inconceivable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> But, my poor child, how do you propose to live?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I'll work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> You don't mean that seriously?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes, godmamma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> You think you have only to ask for work and it will fall from
the skies!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I have a few dollars in my purse which will keep me until I
have found something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Your purse will be empty before you've made a cent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I'm sure it won't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Now, my dear, you're tired, and nervous, and upset. You can't
look at things calmly. We can talk about this again to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes, godpapa. But I shan't have changed my mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> I know you have a strong will of your own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Let us talk sensibly and reasonably. You propose to live all
alone in Paris. Good. Where will you live?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I shall hire a little flat&mdash;or a room somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Like a workgirl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Like a workgirl. There's nothing to be ashamed of in that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> And you are going to earn your own living. How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I shall work. There's nothing to be ashamed of in that, either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> I see. But a properly brought up young lady doesn't work for her
living if she can possibly avoid it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> And above all, a properly brought up young lady doesn't
live all alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> All the same&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> You are perfectly free. There's no doubt about that. We
have no power to prevent you from doing exactly as you choose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> But your father left you in my care.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Please, godmamma, don't be hard upon me. I feel you think I'm
ungrateful, though you don't say so. I know that often and often I shall
long for your kindness and for the home where you've given me a place.
I've shocked you. Do please forgive me. I'm made like that, and made
differently from you. I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> say you're not right; I only say I'm
different. Certain ideas have come to me from being educated at the
Lyc&eacute;e and from all these books I've read. I think I'm able to earn my
own living, and so I look upon it as my bounden duty not to trespass
upon your charity. It's a question of personal dignity. Don't you think
that I'm right, godfather? [<i>With a change of tone</i>] Besides, if I did
go to Evreux with you, what should I do there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> It's pretty easy to guess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Yes, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> You would live with us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret</span> [<i>not very kindly</i>] You would have a home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes, yes, I know all that; and it would be a great happiness.
But what should I <i>do</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> You would do what all well brought up young girls in your
position do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You mean I should do nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Nothing! No, not nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Pay visits, practise a bit; some crochet and a little
photography? That's to say, nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> You were brought up to that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I should never have dared to put it into words. But afterwards?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Afterwards?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> How long would that last?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Until you marry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I shall never marry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>very gently</i>] Oh, godfather, you know why not. I have no
money. [<i>A silence</i>] So I'm going to try and get work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Work! Now, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, you know what women are like who try to earn
their own living. You think you can support yourself. How?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Perhaps I'm mistaken, but I think I can support myself by my
pen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Be a bluestocking?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> That means a Bohemian life, with everything upside down,
and a cigarette always between your lips.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>laughing</i>] Neither Bohemia, nor the upside down, nor the
cigarette are indispensable, godmother. Your information is neither
firsthand nor up-to-date.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> In a month's time you'll want to give it up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Under those circumstances there's no harm in letting me make
the experiment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Now, my dear child, don't you know that even with your
cleverness you may have to wait years before you make a penny. I've been
an editor. I know what I'm talking about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> She's made up her mind, there's no use saying any more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> But <i>I</i> want to talk to her now. Will you be so good as to
listen to me, Mademoiselle Th&eacute;r&egrave;se? [<i>To Madame Gu&eacute;ret</i>] I wonder if I
might be allowed to have a few minutes with her alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Most willingly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret</span> [<i>to his wife</i>] Come, Marguerite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Gu&eacute;ret.</span> It's no use making up your mind to the worst in these
days; life always keeps a surprise for you. Let's go. [<i>She goes out
with her husband</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> My child, I have undertaken to say something to you that I fear
will hurt you, and it's very difficult. You know that I'm only Ren&eacute;'s
uncle by marriage. So it's not on my own account that I speak. I speak
for his parents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Don't say another word, Monsieur F&eacute;liat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> I perfectly
understand. I'm going to release him from his engagement. I shall write
to him this very night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> My sister-in-law and her husband are most unhappy about all
this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I'm grateful to you all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Their affection for you is not in any way diminished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> And&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>imploringly</i>] Please, <i>please</i>, Monsieur F&eacute;liat, don't say any
more; what's the good of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> I beg your pardon, my dear. I am a little upset. I was
expecting&mdash;er, er&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Expecting what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> I expected some resistance on your part, perhaps indignation. It
must be very hard for you; you were very fond of Ren&eacute;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> What's the good of talking about that? Of course he can't marry
me now that I've not got a penny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> You know&mdash;as a matter of fact&mdash;I&mdash;my old-fashioned ideas&mdash;well,
you go on surprising me. But this time my surprise is accompanied
by&mdash;shall I say respect?&mdash;and by sympathy. I expected tears, which would
have been very natural, because I know that your affection for Ren&eacute; was
very great.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I can keep my tears to myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Yes&mdash;&mdash;Oh, I&mdash;&mdash;at least&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Let's consider it settled. Please don't talk to me about it any
more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Very well. Now will you allow me to say one word to you about
your future?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I shan't change my mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Perhaps not; all the same I want to advise you like&mdash;well, like
an old uncle. For several years you have been spending your holidays
with me at La<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> Tremblaye. And I have a real affection for you. So you'll
listen to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> With all my heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> You're making a mistake. Your ideas do you credit, but believe
me, you're laying up trouble for yourself in the future. [<i>She makes a
movement to interrupt him</i>] Wait. I don't want to argue. I want you to
listen to me, and I want to persuade you to follow my advice. Come to
Evreux and you may be perfectly certain that you won't be left an old
maid all your life. Even without money you'll find a husband there.
You're too pretty, too charming, too well educated not to turn the head
of some worthy gentleman. You made a sensation at the reception at the
Pr&eacute;fecture. If you don't know that already, I tell you so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I'm extremely flattered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Do you know that if&mdash;well, if you decide to marry&mdash;I might&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> But I've <i>not</i> decided to marry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> All right, all right, I am speaking about later on. Well, you've
seen Monsieur Baudoin and Monsieur Gambard&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I haven't the slightest intention of&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat</span> [<i>interrupting</i>] There's no question of anything immediate. But
for a person as wise and sensible as you are, the position of both the
one and the other deserves&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I know them both.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Yes; but&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Now look here. If I had two hundred thousand francs, would you
suggest that I should marry either of them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Certainly not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> There, you see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> But you've <i>not</i> got two hundred thousand francs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>without showing any anger or annoyance</i>] The last thing I want
is to be exacting. But really, Monsieur F&eacute;liat, think for a minute. If I
were to marry a man I could not possibly love, I should marry him for
his money. [<i>Looking straight at him</i>] And in that case the only
difference between me and the women I am not supposed to know anything
about would be that a little ceremony had been performed over me and not
over them. Don't you agree with me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> But, my dear, you say such extraordinary things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Well, do you consider that less dishonoring than working?
Honestly now, do you? I think that the best thing about women earning
their living is that it'll save them from being put into exactly that
position.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> The right thing for woman is marriage. That's her proper
position.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> It's sometimes an unhappy one. [<i>A maid comes in bringing a
card to Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, who says</i>] Ask the lady kindly to wait a moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maid.</span> Yes, Mademoiselle. [<i>The maid goes out</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Well, I'm off. I shall go and see Ren&eacute;. Then you'll write to
him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> This very evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> He'll want to see you. My child, will you have the courage to
resist him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You needn't trouble about that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> If he was mad enough to want to do without his parents' consent,
they wish me to tell you that they would never speak to him again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> That he would be a stranger to them. You understand all that
that means?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>discouraged</i>] Yes, yes; oh yes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> If you are not strong enough to stand out against his
entreaties, you will be his ruin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I quite understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> People would think very badly of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Please don't say any more, I quite understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Then I may trust you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You may trust me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat</span> [<i>fatherly and approving</i>] Thank you. [<i>He holds out his hand</i>]
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, you're&mdash;well&mdash;you're splendid. I like courage. I wish you
success with all my heart. I really wish you success. But if, in the
future, you should want a friend&mdash;the very strongest may find themselves
in that position&mdash;let me be that friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>taking the hand which F&eacute;liat holds out to her</i>] I'm grateful,
very grateful, Monsieur. Thank you. But I hope I shall be able to earn
my own living. That is all I want.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> I wish you every success. Good-bye, Mademoiselle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Good-bye, Monsieur. [<i>He goes out. She crosses to another door
and brings in Madame N&eacute;risse</i>] How good of you to come, dear Madame. Too
bad you should have the trouble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Nonsense, my dear. I wanted to come. I'm so anxious to
show you these two photographs and consult you about which we're to
publish. I expected to find you very tired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I am not the least tired, and I'm delighted to see you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse</span> [<i>showing Th&eacute;r&egrave;se the photographs</i>] This is more
brilliant, that's more dreamy. I like this one. What do you think?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I like this one too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Then that's settled. [<i>Putting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> down the photographs</i>]
What a success you had this evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes; people are very kind. [<i>Seriously</i>] I'm so glad you've
come just now, dear Madame, so that we can have a few minutes' quiet
talk. I have something most important to say to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Anything I can do for you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Well, I'll explain. And please do talk to me quite openly and
frankly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> I will indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You told me that my article was very much liked. I can quite
believe that you may have exaggerated a little out of kindness to me. I
want to know really whether you think I write well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Dear Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, ask Madame Gu&eacute;ret to tell you what I said
to her just now about that very thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Then you think my collaboration might be really useful to
<i>Feminine Art</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> There's nothing more useful to a paper like ours than
the collaboration of girls in society.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Would you like me to send you some more stories like the first?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> As many as you can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> And&mdash;[<i>She hesitates a moment</i>] and would you pay me the same
price for them as for the one you've just published?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Yes, exactly the same; and I shall be very glad to get
them. I like your work; you have an exceptionally light touch; people
won't get tired of reading your stuff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Oh, I hope that's true! I'm going to tell you some bad news.
For family reasons my godfather and godmother are going to leave Paris.
I shall stay here by myself, and I shall have to live by my pen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> What an idea!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> It's not an idea, it's a necessity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> What do you mean? A necessity? Monsieur Gu&eacute;ret&mdash;. But I
mustn't be inquisitive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You're not inquisitive, and I'll tell you all about it very
soon; we haven't got time now. Can you promise to take a weekly article
from me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse</span> [<i>with less confidence</i>] Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>joyfully</i>] You can! Oh, thank you, thank you! I can't tell you
how you've relieved my mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> My dear child. I am glad you've spoken to me plainly. I
will do everything I possibly can. I'm extremely fond of you. I don't
think the Directors will object.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Why should they have anything to do with it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse</span> [<i>doubtfully</i>] Perhaps not, but&mdash;the Directors like to
give each number a character of its own. It's a thing they're very
particular about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I could write about very different subjects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> I know you could, but it would be always the same
signature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Well, every now and then I might sign a fancy name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> That would be quite easy, and I don't think the
Directors would mind. They might say it was a fresh name to make itself
known and liked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> We'll try and manage it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> We shall have to fight against some jealousy. The
Directors have prot&eacute;g&eacute;es. The wife of one of them has been waiting to
get an innings for more than two months. There are so many girls and
women who write nowadays.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes; but generally speaking their work is not worth much, I
think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Oh, I don't know that. There are a great many who have
real talent. People don't realize what a lot of girls there are who have
talent. But, still, if I'm not able to take an article every week, you
may rely upon me to take one as often as I possibly can. Oh, I shall
make myself some enemies for your sake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>in consternation</i>] Enemies? How do you mean enemies?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> My dear, it alters everything if you become a
professional. Let me see if I can explain. We have our regular
contributors. The editor makes them understand that they must expect to
run the gantlet of the occasional competition of society women; because,
if these women are allowed to write, it interests them and their
families in the paper, and it's an excellent advertisement for us.
That'll explain to you, by the way, why we sometimes publish articles
not quite up to our standard. But if it's a matter of regular,
professional work, we have to be more careful. We have to respect
established rights and consider people who've been with us a long time.
There is only a limited space in each number, and a lot of people have
to live out of that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>who has gone quite white</i>] Yes, I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse</span> [<i>who sees Th&eacute;r&egrave;se's emotion</i>] How sorry I am for you! If
you only knew how I feel for you! Don't look so unhappy. [<i>Th&eacute;r&egrave;se makes
a gesture of despair</i>] You're not an ordinary girl, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, and it
shall never be said that I didn't do all I could for you. Listen. I told
you just now that I had some big projects in my mind. You shall know
what they are. My husband and I are going to start an important weekly
feminist paper on absolutely new lines.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> It's going to leave everything
that's been done up to now miles behind. My husband shall explain his
ideas to you himself. It'll be advanced and superior and all that, and
at the same time most practical. Even to think of it has been a touch of
genius. When you meet my husband you'll find that he's altogether out of
the common. He's so clever, and he'd be in the very first rank in
journalism if it wasn't for the envy and jealousy of other men who've
intrigued against him and kept him down. I don't believe he has his
equal in Paris as a journalist, I'll read you some of his verses, and
you'll see that he's a great poet too. But I shall run on forever. Only
yesterday he got the last of the capital that's needed for founding the
paper; it's been definitely promised. We're ready to set about
collecting our staff. We shall have leading articles, of course, and
literary articles. Do you want me to talk to him about you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Of course I do. But&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> We want to start a really smart, respectable woman's
paper; of course without sacrificing our principles. Our title by itself
proves that. It's to be called <i>Woman Free</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I'll give you my answer to-morrow&mdash;or this evening, if you
like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse</span> [<i>hesitatingly</i>] Before I go&mdash;as we're to be thrown a
good deal together&mdash;I must tell you something about myself&mdash;a secret. I
hope you won't care for me less when you know it. I call myself Madame
N&eacute;risse. But I have no legal right to the name. That's why I've always
found some reason for not introducing Monsieur N&eacute;risse to you and your
people. He's married&mdash;married to a woman who's not worthy of him. She
lives in an out-of-the-way place in the country and will not consent to
a divorce. My dear Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, it makes me very unhappy. I live<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> only for
him. I don't think a woman can be fonder of a man than I am of him. He's
so superior to other men. But unfortunately I met him too late. I felt I
ought to tell you this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Your telling me has added to my friendship for you. I can guess
how unhappy you are. Probably I'll go this very evening to your house
and see your husband and hear from him if he thinks I can be of use.
Anyway, thank you very much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> And thank <i>you</i> for the way you take this. Good-bye for
the present.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>She goes out. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se stands thinking for a moment, then
Ren&eacute; comes in. He is very much upset.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Ren&eacute;!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, it can't be true! It's not possible! It's not all
over&mdash;our love?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> We must be brave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> But I can't give you up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I've lost every penny, Ren&eacute; dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> But I don't love you any the less for that. I can't give you up,
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se. I <i>can't</i> give you up. I love you, I love you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Oh, Ren&eacute;, don't! I need all my courage to face this. Help me.
Don't you see, your people will never consent now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> My uncle told me so. But I'll see them. I'll persuade them. I'll
explain to them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You know very well they never really liked me, and that they'll
be glad of this opportunity of breaking it off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> I don't know what to do. But I <i>cannot</i> give you up. What would
become of me without you? You're everything to me, everything. And
suddenly&mdash;because of this dreadful thing&mdash;I must give up my whole life's
happiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Your people are quite right, Ren&eacute;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> And you, <i>you</i> say that!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>He hides his face in his hands. A silence.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>gently removing his hands</i>] Look at me, Ren&eacute;. You're crying.
Oh, my dear love!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;</span> [<i>taking her in his arms</i>] I love you, I love you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> And I love you. Oh, please don't cry any more! [<i>She kisses
him</i>] Ren&eacute;, dear, don't cry any more! You break my heart. I can't bear
it, I'm forgetting all I ought to say to you. [<i>Breaking down</i>] Oh, how
dreadful this is! [<i>They cry together. Then she draws herself away from
him, saying</i>] This is madness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Ah, stay, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> No. We mustn't do this; we must be brave. Oh, why did you come
here? I was going to write to you. We're quite helpless against this
dreadful misfortune.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> I don't know what to do! But I <i>can't</i> give you up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>to herself</i>] I must do the right thing. [<i>To him</i>] Ren&eacute;, stop
crying. Listen to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> I love you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes; there's our love. But besides that there's life, and life
is cruel and too strong for our love. There is your future, my dearest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> My future is to love you. My future is nothing if I lose you. [<i>He
buries his face in his hands</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You can't marry a girl without any money. That's a dreadful
fact, like a stone wall. We shall only break ourselves to pieces if we
dash ourselves against it. Listen, oh, please listen to me. Don't you
hear what I'm saying? Ren&eacute;&mdash;dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> I'm listening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I give you your freedom without any bitterness or hardness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> I don't want it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Now listen. You mustn't sacrifice your whole life for a love
affair, no matter how great the love is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> It's by losing you I shall sacrifice my life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Try and be brave; control yourself. Let us face this quietly.
Suppose we do without your people's consent. What will become of us? Try
to look the thing in the face. How should we live? Ren&eacute;, it's horrible
to bring our love down to the level of these miserable realities, but
facts are facts. You know very well that if you marry me without your
father and mother's consent, they won't give you any money. Isn't that
so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Oh! father is hard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> He's quite right, my dear, quite right. If I was your sister, I
should advise you not to give up the position you have been brought up
in and the profession you've been educated for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> But I love you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>moved</i>] And I love you. Well, we've got to forget one another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> That's impossible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> We must be wise enough to&mdash;[<i>She stops, her voice breaks</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Oh! how unhappy I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>controlling herself</i>] Don't let yourself go. We're not in
dreamland. If you keep on saying "I am unhappy," you'll be unhappy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> I love you so. Oh, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, how I love you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>softly</i>] You'll forget me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Never.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes. You'll remember me in a way, of course. But you're young.
Very soon you'll be able to live, to laugh, to love, to work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> My dearest! I don't know what to say. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> can't talk of it. I only
know one thing&mdash;I can't let you go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> But we should be miserable, Ren&eacute;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Miserable <i>together</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Think, dear, think. It will be years before you can earn your
own living, won't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> But I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Now you know you've tried already. Only last year you wanted to
leave home and be independent, and you had to go back because you were
starving. Isn't that true?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> It's dreadful, dreadful! [<i>He is overcome, terrified</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> So we must look at life as it is, practically, mustn't we? We
have to have lodging and furniture and clothes. How are we to manage?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> It's dreadful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> How would you bear to see me going about in rags? [<i>He is
silent. She waits, looking at him, hoping for a word of strength or
courage. It does not come. She draws herself up slowly, her face
hardening</i>] You can't face that, can you? Tell me. Can you face that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>humiliated by his want of courage and infected by his
weakness</i>] So you see, I'm right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;</span> [<i>sobbing</i>] Oh! Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>setting her teeth</i>] Oh, can you do nothing but cry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> What a useless creature I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> There, now, you see you're better!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> I'm ashamed of being so good-for-nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>hopeless</i>] You're just like all the others. Now, don't be
miserable. I'm not angry with you; you are doing what I told you we must
do, and you agree. Go, Ren&eacute;. Say good-bye. Good-bye, Ren&eacute;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Th&eacute;r&egrave;se!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>her nerves on edge</i>] Everything we can say is useless, and
it'll only torture and humiliate us. We must end this&mdash;now&mdash;at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> I shall always love you, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes&mdash;exactly&mdash;now go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Oh, my God!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> I'll go and see my people. They'll never be so cruel&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes, yes, all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> I'll write you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes&mdash;that's it&mdash;you'll write.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> I shall see you again, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se? [<i>He goes slowly to the door</i>]</p>

a sudden, she bursts out into passionate sobs, having lost all control
of herself, and cries wildly</i>] Ren&eacute;!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>completely at the mercy of her feelings</i>] Suppose&mdash;suppose
after all, we <i>did</i> it? Listen. I love you far more than you know, more
than I have ever let you know. A foolish feeling of self-respect made me
hide a lot from you. Trust me. Trust your future to me. Marry me all the
same. Believe in me. Marry me. You don't know how strong I am and all
the things I can do. I will work, and you will work. You didn't get on
when you were alone, but you will when you have me with you. I'll keep
you brave when things go badly, and I'll be happy with you when they go
right. Ren&eacute;, I'll be content with so little! The simplest, humblest,
hardest life, until we've made our way together&mdash;<i>together</i>, Ren&eacute;, and
conquered a place in the world for ourselves, that we'll owe to no one
but ourselves. Let us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> have courage&mdash;[<i>At this point she looks at him,

<h2>ACT II</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Scene:</span>&mdash;<i>A sitting-room at the offices of "Woman Free." The
door at the back opens into an entrance hall. The general
editorial office is to the right, Monsieur N&eacute;risse's room to
the left. At the back, also to the left, is another door
opening into a smaller sitting-room. There are papers and
periodicals upon the tables.</i></p>

<p><i>The curtain rises upon Monsieur Mafflu. He is a man of
about fifty, dressed for ease rather than elegance, and a
little vulgar. He turns over the papers on the tables,
studies himself in the mirror, and readjusts his tie. Madame
N&eacute;risse then comes in. She has Monsieur Mafflu's visiting
card in her hand. They bow to each other.</i></p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Mafflu.</span> My card will have informed you that I am Monsieur
Mafflu.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Yes. Won't you sit down?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Mafflu.</span> I am your new landlord, Madame. I have just bought this
house. I've retired from business. I was afraid I shouldn't have enough
to do, so I've bought some houses. I am my own agent. It gives me
something to do. If a tenant wants repairs done, I go and see him. I
love a bit of a gossip; it passes away an hour or so. In that way I make
people's acquaintance&mdash;nice people. I didn't buy any of the houses where
poor people live, though they're better business. I should never have
had the heart to turn out the ones that didn't pay, and I should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> have
been obliged to start an agent, and all my plan would have been upset.
[<i>A pause</i>] Now, Madame, for what brought me here. I hope you'll forgive
me for the trouble I'm giving you&mdash;and I'm sorry&mdash;but I've come to give
you notice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Indeed! May I ask what your reason is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Mafflu.</span> I am just on the point of letting the second floor. My
future tenant has young daughters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> I'm afraid I don't see what that has got to do with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Mafflu.</span> Well&mdash;he'll live only in a house in which all the
tenants are private families.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> But we make no noise. We are not in any way
objectionable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Mafflu.</span> Oh, no, no; not at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Well, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Mafflu.</span> How shall I explain? I'm certain you're perfectly all
right, and all the ladies who are with you here too, but I've had to
give in that house property is depreciated by people that work; all the
more if the people are ladies, and most of all if they're ladies who
write books or bring out a newspaper with such a name as <i>Woman Free</i>.
People who know nothing about it think from such a name&mdash;oh, bless you,
I understand all that's rubbish, but&mdash;well&mdash;the letting value of the
house, you see. [<i>He laughs</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> The sight of women who work for their living offends
these people, does it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Mafflu.</span> Yes, that's the idea. A woman who works is always a
little&mdash;hum&mdash;well&mdash;you know what I mean. Of course I mean nothing to
annoy you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> You mean that your future tenants don't want their young
ladies to have our example before them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Mafflu.</span> No! That's just what they don't. Having independent
sort of people like you about makes 'em uneasy. For me, you know, I
wouldn't bother about it&mdash;only&mdash;of course you don't see it this way, but
you're odd&mdash;off the common somehow. You make one feel queer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> But there are plenty of women who work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Mafflu.</span> Oh, common women, yes; oh, that's all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> If you have children, they have nurses and governesses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Mafflu.</span> Oh, those. They work, of course. They work for me,
that's quite different. But you&mdash;What bothers these ladies, Madame
Mafflu and all the others, is that you're in our own class. As for me I
stick to the old saying, "Woman's place is the home."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> But there are women who have got no home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Mafflu.</span> That's their own fault.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Very often it's not at all their own fault. Where are
they to go? Into the streets?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Mafflu.</span> I know, I know. There's all that. Still women can work
without being feminists.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Have you any idea what you mean by "feminist"?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Mafflu.</span> Not very clear. I know the people I live among don't
know everything. I grant you all that. But <i>Woman Free! Woman Free!</i>
Madame Mafflu wants to know what liberty&mdash;or what liberties&mdash;singular or
plural; do you take me?&mdash;ha! ha! There might be questions asked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse</span> [<i>laughing</i>] You must do me the honor of introducing me
to Madame Mafflu. She must be an interesting woman. I'll go and see
her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Mafflu.</span> Oh, do! But not on a Wednesday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Mafflu.</span> 'Cos Wednesday's her day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse</span> [<i>gayly</i>] I must give it up, then, as I'm free only on
Wednesdays.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Mafflu.</span> I should like her to see for herself how nice you are.
Her friends have been talking to her. They thought that you&mdash;well&mdash;they
say feminist women are like the women were in the time of the Commune.
They said perhaps you'd even go on a deputation!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> You wouldn't approve of that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Mafflu.</span> Oh, talkin' of that, one of my friends has an argument
nobody can answer. "Let these women," he says, "let 'em do their
military service."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Well, you tell him that if men make wars, women make
soldiers; and get killed at that work too, sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Mafflu</span> [<i>after reflecting for some moments</i>] I'll tell him, but
he won't understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Well, no matter. I won't detain you any longer, Monsieur
Mafflu.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Mafflu.</span> Oh! Madame. I should like to stay and talk to you for
hours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse</span> [<i>laughing</i>] You're too kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Mafflu.</span> Then you forgive me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse</span> [<i>going to the door with him</i>] What would one not forgive
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Mafflu</span> [<i>turning back</i>] I say&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> No, no. Good-bye, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Why don't you read your letter? You see it's open.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I'll shut it up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Read it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Shall I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Yes, do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>reading</i>] Oh, it's too much. This is too kind. With a letter
like this my article is certain to be read. Monsieur N&eacute;risse <i>is</i> kind!
Will you tell him how very grateful I am?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse</span> [<i>coldly</i>] Yes. [<i>She makes an effort to be kind</i>] I'll
tell him, of course. But I dictated the letter myself. Monsieur N&eacute;risse
only signed it. [<i>She rings</i>]<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Then I have one more kindness to thank you for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse</span> [<i>to the page boy</i>] I expect Monsieur Cazar&egrave;s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy.</span> Monsieur&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Our old editor&mdash;Monsieur Cazar&egrave;s. You know him very
well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy.</span> Oh, yes, Madame, yes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> He will have another gentleman with him. You must show
them straight into Monsieur N&eacute;risse's room and let me know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy.</span> Yes, Madame.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>During this conversation Th&eacute;r&egrave;se has taken off her hat and

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Monsieur Cazar&egrave;s is bringing us a new backer. We're
going to make changes in the paper. I'll tell you all about it
presently. [<i>With a change of tone</i>] Tell me, what was there between you
and Monsieur Cazar&egrave;s?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>simply</i>] Nothing at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Isn't he just a wee bit in love with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I haven't the least idea. He's said nothing to me about it, if
he is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> He's always behaved quite nicely to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Always.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> And Monsieur N&eacute;risse?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Monsieur N&eacute;risse? I don't understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Oh, yes, you do. Has he ever made love to you?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> [<i>hurt</i>] Oh, Madame!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> [<i>looking closely at her and then taking both her hands
affectionately</i>] Forgive me, dear child. I know how good and straight
you are. You mustn't mind the things I say. Sometimes I'm horrid I know.
I have an idea that Monsieur N&eacute;risse is not as fond of me as he used to
be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Oh, indeed that's only your fancy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> I hope so. I'm a bit nervous I think. I've such a lot of
trouble with the paper just now. It's not going well. [<i>Gesture of
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</i>] We're going to try something fresh. This time I think it'll be
all right. You'll see it will. [<i>A pause</i>] What's that? Did he call? I'm
sure that idiot of a boy hasn't made up his fire, and he'd never think
of it. He's like a great baby. [<i>As she goes towards Monsieur N&eacute;risse's
door&mdash;the door on the left&mdash;the door on the right opens, and
Mademoiselle Gr&eacute;goire comes in. She has taken off her hat. Madame

Gr&eacute;goire! [<i>To Mademoiselle Gr&eacute;goire</i>] This is Mademoiselle Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.
[<i>They shake hands</i>] I spoke to you about her. She'll explain everything
to you in no time. I'll come back very soon and introduce you to the
others. Excuse me for a minute. [<i>She goes out to the left</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> [<i>pleasantly</i>] I really don't know what Madame N&eacute;risse wants me
to explain to you. You know our paper?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle Gr&eacute;goire.</span> No, I've never seen it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Never seen it! Never seen <i>Woman Free</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle Gr&eacute;goire.</span> Never. I only know it by name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> How odd! Well, here's a copy. It's in two parts, you see, and
they're quite different from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> each other. Here the doctrine, there the
attractions. Madame N&eacute;risse thought of that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle Gr&eacute;goire</span> [<i>reading as she turns over the leaves</i>] "Votes
for Women."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>reading with her</i>] "Votes for Women," "An End of Slavery." And
then, on here, lighter things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle Gr&eacute;goire.</span> Frivolities?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Frivolities. A story. "Beauty Notes."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle Gr&eacute;goire</span> [<i>reading and laughing a little</i>] "The Doctor's
Page."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Oh, too bad! But it wasn't I who first said frivolities!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle Gr&eacute;goire</span> [<i>still laughing</i>] I shall bear up. And what comes
after "The Doctor's Page"?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> "Beauty Notes" and "Gleanings."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle Gr&eacute;goire.</span> Gleanings?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes. It's a column where real and imaginary subscribers
exchange notes about cookery receipts, and housekeeping tips, and hair
lotions, and that sort of thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle Gr&eacute;goire.</span> Quite a good thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I most confess it's the best read part.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle Gr&eacute;goire.</span> I'm not at all surprised.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I'm afraid we can't conceal from ourselves that Monsieur
N&eacute;risse has not altogether succeeded. Each of us is inclined to like
only her own section. We've a girl here, Caroline Legrand, one of the
staff, who's tremendously go-a-head. You should hear her on the subject
of "Soap of the Sylphs" and "Oriental Balm."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle Gr&eacute;goire.</span> It makes her furious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> She's a sort of rampageous saint; ferocious and affectionate by
turns, a bit ridiculous perhaps, but delightful and generous. She's so
simple nasty people could easily make a fool of her, but all nice people
like her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle Gr&eacute;goire.</span> Shall I have much to do with her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Not much. You'll be under Mademoiselle de Meuriot, and you'll
be lucky. She's a dear. She's been sacrificing herself all her life.
She's my great friend&mdash;the only one I have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle Gr&eacute;goire</span> [<i>taking up the paper again</i>] But how's this? Your
contributors are all men. Gabriel de&mdash;, Camille de&mdash;, Claud de&mdash;, Ren&eacute;
de&mdash;, Marcel de&mdash;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Well! I never noticed that before. They're the pen-names of our
writers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle Gr&eacute;goire.</span> All men's names?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes. People still think more of men as writers. You see they
are names that might be either a man's or a woman's. Camille, Ren&eacute;,
Gabriel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle Gr&eacute;goire.</span> There's only one woman's name&mdash;Vicomtesse de
Renneville.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> That's snobbery! It's Madame N&eacute;risse's pen-name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle Gr&eacute;goire.</span> Well, I suppose it's good business.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Mademoiselle de Meuriot comes in at the back, bringing a
packet of letters.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> The post's come, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> This is Mademoiselle de Meuriot. [<i>Introducing Mademoiselle

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> You're welcome, Mademoiselle.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The door on the left opens and Madame N&eacute;risse appears
backwards, still talking to Monsieur N&eacute;risse, who is
invisible in the inner room.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Yes, dearest. Yes, dearest. Yes, dearest.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p><i>Mademoiselle Gr&eacute;goire looks up at Madame N&eacute;risse.</i></p>

<p><i>Mademoiselle de Meuriot and Th&eacute;r&egrave;se turn away their heads
to hide their smiles; finally Madame N&eacute;risse shuts the door,
not having noticed anything, and comes forward. She speaks
to Mademoiselle Gr&eacute;goire.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Come, my dear. I'll introduce you to the others. [<i>To
Mademoiselle de Meuriot</i>] Ah! the post has come. Open the letters,
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, will you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> Yes, we will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse</span> [<i>at the door on the right, to Mademoiselle Gr&eacute;goire</i>]
You first. [<i>They go out</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot</span> [<i>smiling</i>] I think our new friend was a bit
amused. She's pretty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes, and she looks capable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> Let's get to work.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>She sits down, at a desk. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se sits near her at the end
of the same desk. During all that follows Th&eacute;r&egrave;se opens
envelopes with a letter opener and passes them to
Mademoiselle de Meuriot, who takes the letters out, glances
at them, and makes three or four little piles of them.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Here! [<i>Holding out the first letter</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot</span> [<i>as she works</i>] And you? How are you this
morning? [<i>Looking closely at her and shaking a finger</i>] You're tired,
little girl. You sat up working last night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I wanted to finish copying out my manuscript. It took me ages,
because I wanted to make it as clear as print.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot</span> [<i>gravely</i>] You know you mustn't be ill,
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> How good you are, Mademoiselle, and how lucky I am to have you
for a friend. What should I do without you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> How about your godmother?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I didn't get on with her. She never could hide her dislike for
me, and it burst out in the end. When she saw that in spite of
everything she could say I was going to leave her, she let herself go
and made a dreadful scene. And, what was worse, my good, kind godfather
joined in! It seemed as if they thought my wanting to be independent was
a direct insult to them. What a lot of letters there are to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> It's the renewal of the subscriptions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Oh, is that it? So you see we parted, not exactly enemies&mdash;but,
well&mdash;on our dignity. We write little letters to one another now, half
cold and half affectionate. I tell you, without you I should be quite
alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> Not more alone than I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I have someone to talk to now and tell my little worries to.
It's not that, even. One always finds people ready to listen to you and
pity you, but what one doesn't find is people one can tell one's most
impossible dreams to and feel sure one won't be laughed at. That's real
friendship. [<i>She stops working as she continues</i>] To dare to think out
loud before another person and let her see the gods of one's secret
idolatry, and to be sure one's not exposing one's precious things to
blasphemy. How I love you for being like you are and for caring for me a
little. [<i>She resumes her work</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> I don't care for you a little, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se! I care
for you very much indeed. I like you because you're brave and hurl
yourself against obstacles like a little battering ram, and because
you're straight and honest and one can depend on you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>who can't get open the letter she holds</i>] Please pass me the
scissors. Thanks. [<i>She cuts open<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> the envelope</i>] I might have been all
those things, and it would have been no good at all, if you hadn't been
able to see them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> Remember that in being friends with you I get
as much as I give. My people were very religious and very proud of their
title. I made up my mind to leave home, but since then I've been quite
alone&mdash;alone for thirty years. I'm selfish in my love for you now. I've
had so little of that sort of happiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You've done so much for women. You've helped so many.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot</span> [<i>touching her piles of letters</i>] Here's another
who won't renew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> What will Madame N&eacute;risse say? [<i>Continuing</i>] You know,
Mademoiselle, it's not only success that I want. I have a great
ambition. I should like to think that because I've lived there might be
a little less suffering in the world. That's the sort of thing that I
can say to nobody but you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot</span> [<i>tenderly</i>] Th&eacute;r&egrave;se has an ardent soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se has an ardent soul. It was you who said that about
me first, and I think I deserve it. [<i>Changing her tone</i>] Here's the
subscriber's book. [<i>She hands the book and continues in her former
voice</i>] Like Guyan, I have more tears than I need to spend on my own
sufferings, so I can give the spare ones to other people. And not only
tears, but courage and consolation that I have no opportunity of using
up myself. Do you understand what I mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> Yes, I understand, my dear. I see my own youth
over again. [<i>Sadly</i>] Oh, I hope that you&mdash;but I don't want to rouse up
those old ghosts; I should only distress you. Perhaps lives like mine
are necessary, if it's only to throw into relief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> lives that are more
beautiful than mine. Keep your lovely dreams. [<i>A silence</i>] When I think
that instead of being an old maid I might have been the mother of a girl
like you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>leaning towards her and kissing her hair</i>] Don't cry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot</span> [<i>tears in her eyes and a smile upon her lips</i>]
No, no, I won't; and when I think that somewhere or other there's a man
you love!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>smiling</i>] Some day or other I must tell you a whole lot of
things about Ren&eacute;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> Have you seen him again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> But you were supposed not to meet any more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>with a mutinous little smile</i>] Yes, we were supposed not to
meet any more. One says those things and then one meets all the same. If
Ren&eacute; had gone on being the feeble and lamentable young man that I parted
from the <i>Barberine</i> evening, I should perhaps have never seen him
again. You don't know what my Ren&eacute; has done, do you now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I've been looking forward so to telling you. [<i>Eagerly</i>] Well,
he's quite changed. He's become a different man. Oh, he's not a marvel
of energy even yet, but he's not the helpless youth who was still
feeding out of his father's hands at twenty-five.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> And how has this great improvement come about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>looking at her knowingly</i>] You'll make me blush.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> Was it for love of you?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I think it <i>was</i> for love of me. Let me tell you. He wanted to
see me again, and he waited at the door when I was coming out from my
work, just as if I was a little milliner's assistant. And then he came
back another evening, and then another. While we were walking from here
to my place we chattered, and chattered, and chattered. We had more to
say to each other than we'd ever had before, and I began to realize that
his want of will and energy was more the result of always hanging on to
his people than anything else. Then there came a crash. [<i>She laughs</i>] A
most fortunate crash. His father formally ordered him not to see me
again; threatened, if he did, to stop his allowance. What do you think
my Ren&eacute; did? He sent back the cheque his people had just given him with
quite a nice, civil, respectful letter. Then he left his office and got
a place in a business house at an absurdly small salary, and he's been
working there ever since. [<i>Laughing</i>] He shocked all the other young
men in the office by the way he stuck to it. He got gradually interested
in what he had to do. He read it all up; the heads of the firm noticed
him and were civil to him, and now they've sent him on important
business to Tunis. And that's what he's done all for love of me! Now,
don't you think I ought to care for him a little? Don't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> Yes, my dear. But then if he's in Tunis?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Oh, he'll come back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> And when will the wedding be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> He's sure his people will give in in the end if he can make
some money. We shall wait.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The page boy comes in with seven or eight round parcels in
his arms.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy.</span> Here are this morning's manuscripts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> Put them with the others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy.</span> There was one lady was quite determined to see you herself. She
said her article was most particular. It's among that lot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> Very well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy.</span> Mademoiselle Caroline Legrand is coming.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>He opens the door and stands back to allow Caroline Legrand
to come in. She is dressed in a long brown tailor-made
overcoat and a white waistcoat, with a yellow necktie.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Legrand.</span> Good-morning, Meuriot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> Good-morning, Caroline Legrand. [<i>They shake
hands</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Legrand.</span> It seems there's something new going on here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> I believe there is, but I know nothing about
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Legrand.</span> I expect the paper's not going well, the jam hasn't
hidden the pill. Even Madame N&eacute;risse's thirtieth article upon divorce at
the desire of one party hasn't succeeded in stirring up enthusiasm this
time. She's been preaching up free love, but she really started the
paper only because she thought it would help her to get the law changed
and allow her to marry her "dearest."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Mademoiselle Legrand, I have some news that will please you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Legrand.</span> Are all the men dead?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> No, not yet; but I've heard that in a small country town
they're starting a Woman's Trade Union.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Legrand.</span> It won't succeed. Women are too stupid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> They've opened a special workshop there, and they're going to
have work that's always been done by men done by women.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Legrand.</span> That's splendid! A woman worker the more is a slave
the less.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot</span> [<i>gravely</i>] Are you quite sure of that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Legrand.</span> Oh, don't you misunderstand me! [<i>Forcibly</i>] Listen to
this. A time will come when people will be as ashamed of having made
women work as they are ashamed now of having kept slaves. But, until
then&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> The employer is rather disturbed about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Legrand.</span> He's quite right. Very soon there'll be a fierce
reaction among the men about this cheap women's labor. There's going to
be a new sex struggle&mdash;the struggle for bread. Man will use all his
strength and all his cruelty to defend himself. There's a time coming
when gallantry and chivalry will go by the board, <i>I</i> can tell you.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Madame N&eacute;risse comes in.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Oh, good-morning, Legrand. I'm glad you're here, I've
been wanting to ask your advice about a new idea I want to start in
<i>Woman Free</i>. A correspondence about getting up a league of society
women&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Legrand.</span> What about the others?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse</span> [<i>continuing, without attending to her</i>]&mdash;and smart
people, who will undertake not to wear ornaments in their hats made of
the wings or the plumage of birds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Legrand.</span> You're giving up <i>Woman Free</i> for <i>Birds Free</i>, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Legrand.</span> You'd better make a league to do away with hats
altogether as a protest against the sweating of the women who stitch the
straw at famine prices and make the ribbon at next to nothing. I shall
be more concerned for the fate of the sparrows when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> I haven't got to
concern myself about the fate of sweated women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Well, of course. That's the article we've got to write.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Legrand.</span> Of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> We'll write it in the form of a letter to a member of
parliament&mdash;it had better be a man, because we're going to put him in
the wrong&mdash;a member of parliament who wants to form the league I
suggested. What you said about the sparrows will be a splendid tag at
the end. Will you write it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Legrand.</span> Rather! It's lucky you don't stick to your ideas very
obstinately, because they can sometimes be improved upon. I think I
shall write your paper for you in future.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Go along and send me in Mademoiselle Gr&eacute;goire and Madame
Chanteuil. They'll bother you, and I want them here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Chanteuil.</span> It's a dreadful job, trying to get advertisements for
a paper that three-quarters of the people she goes to have never heard

they're full of good qualities, with some little amiable weaknesses and
the sort of defects one enjoys boasting about. [<i>Going on reading</i>]
"About using whites of eggs to take the sharpness out of sorrel," "To

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Chanteuil.</span> Tell her to go to bed early and alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> That's too easy, she wouldn't believe in it.
Find something else. [<i>Continuing to read</i>] "To make them firm without

whiten the teeth," "To make the hair lighter," "To give firmness to the

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Indeed it's a great deal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> Nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes, I'm sure to be received quite differently with that letter

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You know very well why.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> You're still angry with me. You do yourself harm by the way you
treat me, you do indeed. Listen, this is the sort of thing. Moranville,
the editor of the review I was talking about, is going to meet me at my
restaurant after dinner. I know he wants just such stories as you write.
But Moranville reads only the manuscripts of people he knows&mdash;he has a
craze about it. Well, I hardly dare propose to you a thing which
nevertheless is perfectly natural among colleagues, to come and dine
with me first and meet him after. I hardly like&mdash;[<i>Th&eacute;r&egrave;se draws herself
up</i>] You see, I'm right. You don't trust me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> On the contrary, I'll go gladly. Madame N&eacute;risse will be with
you of course?</p>

everywhere I go? Say no more about it. Whatever I say will only make you
suspicious. [<i>With a sigh</i>] All this misunderstanding and suspicion is
horrible to me. How stupid the world is! There are times when I feel
disgusted with everything, myself included! I'm getting old. I'm a
failure. I'm losing my time and wasting my life over this ridiculous
paper, which will never be anything but an obscure rag. I shall have
done for myself soon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>awkwardly, for something to say</i>] Don't say that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> Yes, I shall. I might have a chance of saving myself yet if I
took things energetically and got free of the whole thing. But I should
have to be quick about it. [<i>A silence. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se does not know what to

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> So unhappy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Yes, they're gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> Is it all settled?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Yes. I am to meet them at the bank at four. But they
wouldn't give way on the question of reducing expenses as regards the
contributors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> And the dates of publication?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> We are to come out fortnightly instead of weekly.
[<i>Indicating the door on the right</i>] You must go and speak to them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> Is Th&eacute;r&egrave;se's salary to be reduced too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> It would be impossible to make distinctions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> Difficult, yes. Still&mdash;I think one might have managed to do
something for her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> I cannot see how she differs from the others. Can you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> Oh, well&mdash;say no more about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> That will be best. [<i>He goes out to the right. To
herself</i>] I should think so indeed! [<i>To Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</i>] While Monsieur
N&eacute;risse was talking to the other man I had a chat with Monsieur Cazar&egrave;s.
He was talking about you. He's a nice fellow, and it's quite a good
family you know. He's steady and fairly well off&mdash;very well off.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>laughing</i>] You talk as if you were offering me a husband!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> And what would you say supposing he had asked me to sound you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I should say that I was very much obliged, but that I decline
the honor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> What's wrong with him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Well then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You can't marry upon that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Have you absolutely made up your mind?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Absolutely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> I think you're making a mistake. I think it all the more
because this chance comes just at a time&mdash;well, you'll understand what I
mean when I've told you something that I have to say to you as
manageress of <i>Woman Free</i>. It's this. You know that in spite of all we
could do we've had to hunt about for more capital. We've found some, but
we've had to submit to very severe conditions. The most important is
that they insist upon a stringent cutting down of expenses. Instead of
coming out every week, <i>Woman Free</i> will be a fortnightly in future, and
we've been obliged to consent to reducing the salaries of the
contributors in proportion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> How much will they be reduced?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> In proportion I tell you. They'll be cut down by one
half.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> And I shall not have enough to live upon even in the simplest
way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> That was exactly what I said to them. And the work will
not be the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> My work will not be the same?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> No; you will be obliged to work at night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> At night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> But then I shall be free all day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> No, you won't. In the daytime you will have to take
charge of the business part of the paper, and in the evening too your
work will not be purely literary, but more of an administrative
character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> It appears to me that I'm asked to accept a smaller salary and
to do double work for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> I am conveying to you the offers of the new Directors;
if they don't suit you, you have only to refuse them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Of course I refuse them, and you may say to the people who have
made them that they must be shameful sweaters to dare to offer women
salaries that leave them no choice between starvation and degradation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Those are strong words, my dear, and you seem to forget
very quickly&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>softening</i>] Yes. Oh, I beg your pardon. But think for a
minute, Madame, and you'll forgive me for being angry. I hardly know
what I'm saying. [<i>Madame N&eacute;risse half turns away</i>] Listen, oh listen!
Forget what I said just now; I'll explain to you. I accept the reduction
of salary. I'll manage. I'll get my expenses down. Only I can't consent
to give up all my time. You know I have some work in hand; you know I
have a big undertaking to which I've given all my life. I've told you
about it, you know about that. You know I can only stand my loneliness
and everything because of the hope I have about this. If people take all
my time, it's the same as if they killed me. I beg you, I implore you,
get them to leave me my evenings free.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> It can't be done.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

go at the end of the month; that's to say to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Take a little time to consider it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I have considered it. They propose that I should commit
suicide. I say no!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> I'm sorry, truly sorry. [<i>She rings. While she waits for

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> You think so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Rather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Legrand.</span> Where, for instance?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> There are other papers in Paris besides this one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> Then you know a lot of others that pay better?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> One will be enough for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Legrand.</span> And you think you'll find a place straight off? You
know there are other people&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I'll give lessons. I took my degree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Legrand.</span> Much good may it do you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> You think you'll be a governess? At one time a
governess could get 1,200 francs, now it's 650 francs&mdash;less than the
cook. And if you were to be a companion&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Why not a lady's maid at once?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Legrand.</span> Yes; lady's maid. That's not a bad idea. It's the only
occupation a girl brought up as rich people bring up their daughters can
be certain to get and to keep, if she's only humble enough.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I shall manage to get along without taking to that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> But, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, have you really been blind to all
that's been going on here? Haven't you constantly seen unfortunate
women, as well brought up and as well educated as yourself, coming
hunting for work? Don't you remember that advertisement of the girl that
Caroline Legrand was interested in? That advertisement has been
appearing in the paper for the last three months. I'll read it to you.
[<i>Caroline Legrand takes up a number of "Women Free" and passes it to
Mademoiselle de Meuriot</i>] Here it is. [<i>Reading</i>] "A young lady of
distinguished appearance, who has taken a high certificate for teaching.
Good musician. Drawing, English, shorthand, etc." I know that girl. She
told me all about her life. D'you know what she's offered? She asked two
francs an hour for teaching the piano. They laughed in her face, because
for that they could get a girl who'd taken first prize at the
Conservatoire. They gave her seventy-five centimes. Deduct from that
seventy-five centimes the price of the journey in that underground, the
wear and tear of clothes, the time lost in going and coming, and then
what do you think is left?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Legrand.</span> Let's be just. She got answers from doubtful places
abroad, letters from old satyrs, and invitations to pose for the
"movies."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> What's left then? The stage. It's quite natural
you should think of the stage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> If one must.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Legrand.</span> If one must! You'd condescend to it, wouldn't you? You
poor child!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> You can't get into the Conservatoire after
twenty-one. Are you under that? No. Are you a genius? No. Well then?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Legrand.</span> Have you a rich lover who will back you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> No. Then you'll get nothing at all in the
theatres except by making friends with half a dozen men or selling
yourself to one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I'll go into a shop. At any rate, when it shuts I shall be
free.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Legrand.</span> You think they're longing for you, don't you? You
forget you'd have to know things for that one doesn't learn by taking a
degree; things like shorthand and typewriting. Do you know there are
twenty thousand women in Paris who want to get into shops and offices
and can't find places?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Chanteuil.</span> I know exactly what's going to become of <i>me</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Legrand.</span> Now you're going to say something silly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Chanteuil.</span> You think so, you've guessed. Well, I tell you, middle
class girls thrown on the world as we are can't get along without a
man&mdash;a husband or a lover. We haven't got the key of the prison door.
We've not learned a trade. We've learned to smile, and dance, and
sing&mdash;parlor tricks. All that's only of use in a love affair or a
marriage. Without a man we're stranded. Our parents have brought us all
up for one career and one only&mdash;the man. I was a fool not to understand
before. Now I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Legrand.</span> Look here, you're not going to take a lover?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Chanteuil.</span> Suppose I am?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Legrand.</span> My dear, you came here full of indignation, clamoring
against the state of society. You called yourself a feminist, but you,
and women like you, are feminists only when it's convenient. There are
no real feminists except ugly women like me or old ones like Meuriot.
You others come about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> us in a swarm and then drop away one after
another to go off to some man. As soon as a lover condescends to throw
the handkerchief you're up and off to him. You <i>want</i> to be slaves. Go,
my dear, and take your lover. That's your fate. Good-night. [<i>She goes
out</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot</span> [<i>to Madame Chanteuil</i>] Don't listen to her, you
poor child. Don't ruin all your life in a fit of despair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Chanteuil.</span> I can't stay here. I'm not a saint and I'm not a fool.
How can I live on what they offer to pay me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> Stay for a little, while you're looking for
something else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Chanteuil.</span> Look for something else! Never! That means all the
horrors I went through, before I came here, over again! No! <i>no! no!</i>
Never! Looking for work means trailing through the mud, toiling up
stairs, ringing bells, being told to call again, calling again to get
more snubs. And then when one thinks one's found something one comes up
against a door guarded by a man who's watching you, and who's got to be
satisfied before you can get into the workroom, or the office, or the
shop, or whatever it may be. And then you've got to begin again with
somebody else and be snubbed again. No. Since it's an accepted, settled,
decided thing that the only career for a woman is to satisfy the
passions of a man, I prefer the one I've chosen myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> And what if he goes off and leaves you with a
baby?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Chanteuil.</span> Well, I'll bring it up. I shan't be the first. Women
do it. It happens to one in every five in Paris. Ask Mademoiselle de
Meuriot, the old maid, if she wouldn't be glad to have one now? When one
grows old it's better to have had a child in that way than not to have
had one at all. Ask her if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> I'm not telling the truth. Ask her if she's
happy in her loneliness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot.</span> Oh, it's true&mdash;it's true! Sometimes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>She bursts into tears. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se goes to her and takes her in
her arms.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Oh, Mademoiselle, dear Mademoiselle!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Chanteuil</span> [<i>between her teeth</i>] Good-bye, Mademoiselle. Good-bye,
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle de Meuriot</span> [<i>to Madame Chanteuil</i>] Wait, wait. I'm going
with you. I am not going to leave you just now.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Mademoiselle de Meuriot goes out with Madame Chanteuil.
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, left alone, buries her head in her hands and
thinks. Then she takes the two books that Madame N&eacute;risse has
handed her, and with a determined swing sits down and starts
working. After a moment Monsieur N&eacute;risse comes in.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> My dear child, I have news for you. Pleasant news, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>rather grimly</i>] Have you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> One little smile, please, or I shall tell you nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I assure you smiling is the last thing I feel like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> If you only knew what I've been doing for you, you wouldn't
receive me so unkindly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> <i>You</i> can do nothing for me. Will you please leave me alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> I don't deserve to be spoken to like that, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se. Listen; we
must come to an understanding. I know you're angry with me still about
what happened last month. I promised you then I would say no more. Have
I kept my word?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes, you have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> Will you always be angry? Is it quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> impossible for us to be
friends? I am constantly giving you proofs of my friendship. I've done
two things for you quite lately. The first was that letter to the editor
you're going to see to-morrow, and the second is what I've done now with
our new backer. It's this. They wanted to sack you or to offer you
humiliating conditions. I said if you didn't stay I wouldn't stay
either. I gave in on other points to get my way about this. I shall have
their final answer to-morrow, and I know I shall succeed if I stick to
my point.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> But what right had you to do such a thing? We agreed to forget
altogether that you had dared to make love to me. D'you really not
understand how that makes it impossible I should ever accept either
assistance or protection from you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> I have still the right to love you in secret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Indeed you have not, and you've kept your secret precious
badly. Madame N&eacute;risse suspects, and I can see quite well that she's
jealous of me. I owe her a great deal; she gave me my first start and
got me my place here. I wouldn't make her unhappy for anything in the
world. As soon as she hears of what you've done what d'you suppose
she'll think?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> I don't care a rap what she thinks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> But I care very much. You've compromised me seriously.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse</span> [<i>sincerely contemptuous</i>] Compromised you! Aha, yes, there's
the word! Oh, you middle class girls! Always the same! What are you
doing here then? What d'you know about life? Nothing. Compromised! Then
all your dreams of elevating humanity, all your ambitions, your career,
the realization of yourself&mdash;you'll give up all that before you'll be
what you describe by that stupid, imbecile, middle class word,
compromised. When you shook yourself free of your family you behaved
like a capable woman. Now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> you're behaving and thinking like a
fashionable doll. Isn't that true? I appeal to your intelligence, to
your mind, to everything in you that lifts you out of the ordinary ruck.
Your precious word compromised is only the twaddle of a countrified
miss. Don't you see that yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>very much out of countenance</i>] Ah, if I were only certain that
you are hiding nothing behind your friendship and your sympathy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse</span> [<i>with perfectly genuine indignation</i>] Hiding? You said hiding?
Is that what you throw in my face? You insult me? What d'you take me
for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I beg your pardon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> What kind of assurance do you want me to give you? Do you
believe in nothing? Is it quite impossible for you to feel frankly and
naturally, and to say "I have confidence in you, and I accept your
friendship"&mdash;a friendship offered to you perfectly honestly and loyally?
It really drives one to despair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>without enthusiasm</i>] Well, yes. I say it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>She puts her hands into the hands Monsieur N&eacute;risse holds
out to her.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> Thank you. [<i>A silence. Then he says in a low voice</i>] Oh,
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, I love you, how I love you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>snatching her hands away</i>] Oh, this is abominable. You set a
trap for me, and my vanity made me fall into it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> I implore you to let me tell you about myself. I'm so miserable
and lonely when you're away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>trying to speak reasonably</i>] I know quite well what you want
to say to me, and it all amounts to this: you love me. It's quite clear,
and I answer you just as clearly: I do <i>not</i> love you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> I'm so unhappy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> If it's true that you're unhappy because I don't love you, that
is a misfortune for you; a misfortune<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> for which I am not in any way
responsible, because you certainly cannot accuse me of having encouraged
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> I don't ask you to love me&mdash;yet. I ask you to allow me to try
and win your love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>almost desperate</i>] Don't dare to say that again. If you were
an honorable man, you couldn't possibly have said these things to me
to-day when my living depends upon you. You know the position I'm in,
and you know that if I don't stay here, there are only two courses open
to me&mdash;to go and live at the expense of my godmother, which I will <i>not</i>
do, or to take the chances of a woman alone looking for work in Paris.
Don't you understand that speaking about your love for me to-day is the
same as driving me into the street?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> If you go into the street, it is by your own choice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Exactly. There's the old, everlasting, scandalous bargain. Sell
yourself or you shall starve. If I give in, I can stay; if I don't&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> <i>I</i> didn't say so. But clearly my efforts to help you will be
greater if I know that I'm working for my friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You actually confess it! You think yourself an honorable man,
and you don't see that what you're doing is the vilest of crimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> Now I ask you. Did I wait for your answer before I began to
defend you and to help you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> No, but you believe I shall give in through gratitude or fear.
Well, don't count upon it. Even if I have to kill myself in the end, I
shall never sell myself, either to you or to anyone else. [<i>In despair</i>]
Then that's what it comes to. Wherever we want to make our way, to have
the right to work and to live, we find the door barred by a man who
says, Give yourself or starve. Because one's on one's own, because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> they
know that there's not another man to start up and defend his <i>property</i>!
It's almost impossible to believe human beings can be so vile to one
another. For food! Just for food! Because they know we shall starve if
we don't give in. Because we have old people, or children at home who
are waiting for us to bring them food, men put this vile condition to
us, to do like the girls in the streets. It's shameful, shameful,
shameful. It's enough to make one shriek out loud with rage and despair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse</span> [<i>speaking sternly</i>] I've never asked you to sell yourself. I
ask you to love me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I shall never love you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse</span> [<i>as before</i>] You'll never love. Neither me nor others. Listen&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>interrupting</i>] I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse</span> [<i>preventing her from speaking</i>] Wait; I insist upon speaking.
You will never love, you say. You will live alone all your life. You're
foolish and self-confident enough to think that you can do without a
man's affection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> But I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse</span> [<i>continuing</i>] I must try to make you understand your folly.
These efforts you're making to escape from the ordinary life of
affection are useless, and it's lucky for you they are useless. You
can't live without love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> All lonely people are wretched. But the lonely woman is twice,
a hundred times more wretched than the man. You've no idea what it is.
It's to pass all your life under suspicion, yes, suspicion. The world
never believes that people live differently from others unless they have
secret reasons, and the world always says that secret reasons are
shameful reasons. And that's not all. Think of the lonely room where you
may cry without anyone to hear you. Think of illness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> where to your
bodily pain is added the mental torture of the fear of dying all alone.
Think of the empty heart, the empty arms always, always. And in old age,
more wretchedness in the regret for a wasted life. And for what and for
whom are you making this sacrifice? For a convention; for a morality
that nobody really believes in. Who'll think the better of you for it?
People won't even believe in your honesty. They will find explanations
for it that would make you die of shame if you knew them. Is that what
you want, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se? I am unhappy. Love me. Oh, if you only&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Please spare me your confidences.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> You think this is only a caprice on my part. You are mistaken.
I ask you to share my life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I will never be your mistress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> You're proud and you're strong. You insist upon marriage. Very
well. I agree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I will not have you! I will not have you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> Why? Tell me why.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I <i>will</i> tell you why; and then, I hope, I shall have done with
you. You're right in one way. I believe I should not be able to live all
alone. I should be too unhappy. But at least I'll keep my right of
choice. If ever I give myself to anyone, it will be to someone I love.
[<i>With vehemence</i>] And I love him, I love him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse</span> [<i>violently</i>] You have a lover! If that's true&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>with a cry of triumph</i>] Oh, have I got to the bottom of your
vulgar, hateful little soul? If there ever was any danger of my giving
in, your expression then would have saved me. You never thought there
could be anything better. A lover! No, I have no lover. I have a love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> I don't see so very much difference.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>proudly</i>] I know you don't, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> shows what you are. This
is the one love of my life, my love for my betrothed. I lost my money
and that separated us, but we found each other again. It's unhappy to be
separated, but we bear our unhappiness out of respect for what you call
prejudices, because we know how our defying them would hurt those we
love. You think me ridiculous, but you cannot imagine how utterly
indifferent I am. I am waiting, we are waiting, with perfect trust and
love. Now d'you understand that I'm perfectly safe from you? Go!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse</span> [<i>in a low voice which trembles with anger and jealousy</i>] How
dare you say that to me, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se? How dare you bring such a picture
before me? I will not allow you to belong to another man. [<i>He advances
towards her</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>in violent excitement</i>] No, no, don't dare! Don't touch me!
don't dare to touch me!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>She cries out those words with such violence and in a voice
of such authority that N&eacute;risse stops and drops into a

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> Forgive me. I'm out of my mind. I don't know what I'm doing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> Yes, I'll go. [<i>He rises and says humbly</i>] I want to ask
you&mdash;you won't leave us?</p>

time to a scene like this. Yes! I shall leave, and leave to-night!

<p><span class="smcap">N&eacute;risse.</span> I implore you. [<i>Hearing a noise outside, suddenly alarmed</i>]
Here she is! Control yourself, I beg of you. Don't tell her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You needn't be afraid.</p>

loyal you are! [<i>To herself</i>] I was honest too, once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Good-bye, Madame. [<i>She begins to tidy her papers</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame N&eacute;risse.</span> Good-bye, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Madame N&eacute;risse goes out.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>When Th&eacute;r&egrave;se is left alone she breaks down and bursts out
crying like a little child. Then she wipes her eyes, puts
her hat on, goes to the cardboard box, and takes out her
veil, which she slips into her little bag. She takes out
Monsieur N&eacute;risse's letter; still crying she puts the letter
into another envelope, which she closes and leaves well in
sight upon the table. Then she takes her little black
moleskin bag and her umbrella and goes out slowly. She is
worn out, almost stooping; and, as the curtain falls, one
sees the poor little figure departing, its shoulders shaken
by sobs.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<h2>ACT III</h2>


<div class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>:&mdash;<i>Th&eacute;r&egrave;se's studio at the bookbinding workshops of Messrs. F&eacute;liat
and Gu&eacute;ret at Evreux. Strewn about are materials for binding books:
patterns, tools, and silks. A glazed door on the right opens into the
general women's workshops, and there is a door leading into a small
office on the left. In the middle, towards the back, is a large drawing
table; several easels stand about. There are some chairs and a small
bureau. Cards hang upon the walls, on which are printed the text of the
Factory Laws. There is a door at the back.</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>It is October.</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Monsieur Gu&eacute;ret and Monsieur F&eacute;liat come in excitedly.</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> I tell you Duriot's men are coming out on strike.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> And I ask you, what's that to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Ours will do the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Oh no, they won't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> You'll see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Duriot's men are furious with the women because of what happened
last year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> They say woman's the enemy in business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Let 'em talk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> They want Duriot to sack all his women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> And I've told you why. There's no danger of anything like that
happening here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> You think so, do you? Well, you'll see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> We shall see.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> You'll give in only after they've broken two or three of your
machines as they did Duriot's, or done something worse, perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> My dear Gu&eacute;ret, I get out of the women for a cent what I have to
pay the men three cents for. And as long as I can economize ten cents on
the piece I shall go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> You'll regret it. If I was in your place&mdash;[<i>He stops</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Well, what would you do if you were in my place?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> What should I do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Yes, what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> I shouldn't take long to think. I'd cut off a finger to save my
hand, I'd turn out every one of the women to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> You're mad. You've always objected to my employing women, and I
know very well why.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Well, let's hear why.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> You want to know. Well, because you've been jealous of Th&eacute;r&egrave;se
ever since she came here six months ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Oh, I say!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> That's it; my sister can't endure her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Marguerite&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> You know she wouldn't even see her when she came down from
Paris; and if Th&eacute;r&egrave;se got work here, it was in spite of Marguerite. I
was wiser than you about this. The girl's courage appealed to me. She's
plucky and intelligent. Oh, I don't want to make myself out cleverer
than I am. I took her a bit out of pity, and I thought she'd draw me a
few designs; that was all I expected. But she has energy and initiative.
She organized the two workrooms, and now she's got the whole thing into
order by starting this Union.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> The Hen's Union.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> That's what the men call her Union. You should hear the things
they say about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Well, long live the Hen's Union! A hen's plucky when it has to
be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Seriously, it's just this Union which has annoyed the men. They
feel it's dangerous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Very well. I'll be ready for them.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Th&eacute;r&egrave;se comes in.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> I'll go and find out what's going on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Yes, do.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Monsieur Gu&eacute;ret goes out.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I've just been seeing the man who makes our finishing tools. He
says it's perfectly easy to make a tool from the drawing I did that
won't be more expensive than the old one. [<i>Looking for a paper and
finding it on the table</i>] Here's the drawing. You see I've thought of
cheapness, but I've not sacrificed utility. After all, it's only a copy
of a Grolier, just a little altered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Very good, but what will the price come out at?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> How much do you think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> I can easily do it. [<i>He calculates during what follows</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> The beating won't be done with a hammer, but in the rolling
machine; the sawing-in and the covering will be done as usual.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat</span> [<i>having finished his sum</i>] Two francs forty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>triumphantly</i>] One franc seventy. You've calculated on the
basis of men's work. But, if you approve, I'll open a new workroom for
women in the old shop. Lucienne can manage it. I could let Madame
Princeteau take Lucienne's present place, and I'll turn out the stuff at
the price I quoted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> But that's first-rate. I give you an absolutely free hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Thank you, Monsieur F&eacute;liat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> How do you think the men will take it? You know that last year,
before you came here, a strike of the workmen was broken by the women
taking the work the men were asking a rise for&mdash;taking it at lower
wages, too. Since then the men feel very strongly against the women.
Your godfather is anxious about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Oh, leave it to me, I'm not afraid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Well done. I like pluck. Go ahead. How lucky I was to get you
here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> How grateful I am to you for believing in me. [<i>Lucienne
appears at the door on the right. She is speaking to a workwoman who is
not visible, while the following conversation goes on</i>] And how good you
are, too, to have given work to poor Lucienne. When I think what you
saved her from! She really owes her life to you. At any rate she owes it
to you that she's living respectably.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Well, I owe <i>you</i> ten per cent reduction on my general expenses.
[<i>With a change of tone</i>] Then that's agreed? You're going ahead?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> I'll go and give the necessary orders. [<i>He goes out</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> It's all right. It's done. He's agreed! I'm to have my new
workroom, and you're to be the head of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Oh, splendid! Then I'm really of some importance here at last.
[<i>A long happy sigh</i>] Oh dear, how happy I am. I'd never have believed I
could have enjoyed the smell of a bindery so. [<i>Sniffing</i>] Glue, and
white of egg, and old leather; it's lovely! Oh, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, what you did
for me in bringing me here! What I owe you! That's what a woman's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> being
free means; it means a woman who earns her own living.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Oh, you're right! Isn't it splendid, Lucienne, ten wretched
women saved, thanks to our new workshop. I've seen Duriot's forewoman.
At any moment fifty women from there may be out of work. I can take on
only ten at present, and I've had to choose. That was dreadful! Thirty
of them are near starvation. I took the worst cases: the old maids, the
girls with babies, the ones whose husbands have gone off and left them,
the widows. Every one of those, but for me, would have been starved or
gone on the streets. I used to want to write books and realize my dreams
that way. Now I can realize them by work. I wish Caroline Legrand could
know what I'm doing. It was she who helped me to get over my silly
pride, and come and ask for work here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Dear Caroline Legrand! Without her! Without you! [<i>With a
change of tone</i>] What d'you suppose happened to me this morning? I had a
visit from Monsieur Gambard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>laughing</i>] Another visit! I shall be jealous!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> You've reason. For the last week that excellent old man has
come every single morning with a book for me to bind. I begged him not
to take so much trouble, and I told him that if he had more work for us
to do, we could send for the books to his house. What d'you think he did
to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I've no idea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> He asked me to marry him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> My dear! What then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Why, then I told him that I was married and separated from my
husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> There's such a thing as divorce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Naughty girl! That's exactly what he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> said. I told him that my
first experience of marriage was not calculated to make me run the
chances of a second. And then he asked me to be his mistress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Indignation of Lucienne!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> No! I really couldn't be angry. He offered so na&iuml;vely to
settle part of his fortune upon me that I was disarmed. I simply told
him I was able to earn my own living, so I was not obliged to sell
myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> And he went off?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> And he went off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>starting suddenly</i>] Was that three o'clock that struck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Yes, but there's nothing very extraordinary in that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Not for you, perhaps. But I made up my mind not to think about
a certain thing until it was three o'clock. I stuck to it&mdash;almost&mdash;not
very easily. Well, my dear, three o'clock to-day is a most solemn hour
in my life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> You don't say so!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> <i>I do.</i> Lucienne, I am so happy. I don't know how I can have
deserved to be as happy as I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne.</span> Good gracious, what's happened in the last five minutes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I'll tell you. One hour ago Ren&eacute; arrived at Evreux. He's come
back from Tunis. Come back a success and a somebody. And now&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Vincent, a workman, comes in.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span> Good-morning, Mademoiselle Th&eacute;r&egrave;se. I want a word with you,
because it's you who engages&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Not the workmen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span> I know. But it's about a woman, about my wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>sharply</i>] Your wife? But I don't want your wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span> I heard as how you were taking on hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes, but I choose them carefully. First of all I take the ones
who need work or are not wanted at home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span> You're quite right&mdash;but I ain't asking you to pay my old woman
very much&mdash;not as much as a man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Why not, if she does the same work?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent</span> [<i>with male superiority</i>] Well, in the first place, she's only a
woman; and, besides, if you didn't make a bit out of it, you wouldn't
take her in the place of a man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> But you get excellent wages here yourself. You can live without
forcing your wife to work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span> Well, anyhow, her few halfpence would be enough to pay for my
tobacco.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucienne</span> [<i>laughing</i>] Come, you don't smoke as much as all that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span> Besides, it'll put a bit more butter on the bread.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> But your wife will take the place of another woman who hasn't
even dry bread perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span> Oh, if one was bothering all the time about other people's
troubles, you'd have enough to do!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Now will you forgive me if I meddle a little in what isn't
exactly my business?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span> Oh, go on, you won't upset me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> What d'you do when you leave the works? You go to the saloon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent</span> [<i>losing control of himself and becoming violent and coarse</i>]
That's yer game, is it! You take me for a regler soaker. That's a bit
too thick, that is. You can go and ask for yourself in all the saloons
round here. Blimey, sometimes I don't drink nothing but water for a week
on end! Can you find anybody as has ever seen me
blue-blind-paralytic&mdash;eh? I'm one of the steady ones, I am. I has a
tiddley in the morning,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> like every man as is a man, to keep out the
fog; then I has a Vermouth before lunch, and a drop of something short
after, just to oil the works like&mdash;and that's the bloomin' lot. Of
course you're bound to have a Pernod before dinner to get your appetite
up; and if I go for a smoke and a wet after supper, well, it's for the
sake of a bit of company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>who has been jotting down figures with a pencil while he has
been talking</i>] Well, that's a franc a day you might have saved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span> A franc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>holding out the paper to him</i>] Add it up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent</span> [<i>a little confused</i>] Oh, I'll take your word for it. I ain't
much good at sums.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> With that franc you might have put a fine lot of butter on
every round of bread.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span> Well, look here, I want a bicycle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Why? You live five minutes' walk from here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span> Yes, but I want to get about a bit on Sundays.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> There's one thing you haven't thought of. You have two little
children. Who'll look after them if your wife comes to work here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span> Don't you worry about that. You takes 'em all dirty to the
cr&egrave;che every morning and gets 'em back in the evenin' all tidied up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> And who's going to get supper ready?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent</span> [<i>na&iuml;vely</i>] Why, the old woman when she comes back from work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> While you take your little drink?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent</span> [<i>the same tone</i>] Oh, yes; I shan't hurry her up too much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Who'll mend your clothes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span> Why, the old woman of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> When?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span> On Sundays.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> While you go off for a run on the bicycle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span> Yes; it'll be a change for her. And at night I'll take her to
see me play billiards. [<i>With a change of tone</i>] That's all settled,
ain't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Indeed, it's not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span> Why not? Aren't you going to open a new workroom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Your wife has no need to work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span> What's that got to do with you? You're taking on the others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> The others are in want.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span> That's nothing to me. You ought to take the wives of the chaps
as works here first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> All I can do is to mention her name at the next meeting of our
Union.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span> Oh, damn your Union&mdash;it's a fair nuisance!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> A Union is always a nuisance to somebody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span> And you'll ask your Union not to take my old woman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I certainly shall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent</span> [<i>rather threateningly</i>] Very well. Things was more comfortable
here before you come from Paris, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>quietly</i>] I'm sorry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span> And they'll be more comfortable when you take your hook back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> That won't be for a good while yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span> I ain't so damned sure about that! Good-afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I'm sure I could.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Are you certain none of them would go back on you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Two or three married women might if their husbands threatened
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Will you try, in a quiet way, to find out about that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes, certainly. [<i>She makes a movement to go out</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Look here, it seems that Duriot has just had a visit from two

protest against the engagement of women. I'm afraid we're going to have

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> You or your ghost?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Where do you come from? Nobody's heard of you for a hundred

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Come now, only six months, and you've had some news.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Where are you from last?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> From Tunis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> And what are you doing here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> I'll tell you all about it. I want to have a bit of a talk with
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Well, we're listening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> You're mighty solemn about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> It's extremely serious business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Don't be tragic. You're here safe and sound; and you've not lost
money, because you'd none to lose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> I've come to marry Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Well, I must say you don't beat about the bush.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> But it's to your own people you've got to say that. What the
devil&mdash;! Th&eacute;r&egrave;se has no more money than she had a year ago. So&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> I'll marry her in spite of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Well, we've nothing to do with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Yes, but I don't want to marry her in spite of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Nor in spite of herself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> I'm certain she won't say no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> But a year ago you solemnly separated; you both agreed
everything was over.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Nothing was over. A year ago I was a fool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> To the point again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> And what are you now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> At any rate I am not quite useless any longer. I'm not a boy now,
obliged to do what he's told because he's perfectly incapable of doing
for himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Have you found something to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> I'm in phosphates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> And what the devil are you in phosphates?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Representative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> How do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> A commercial traveller, as father said with great contempt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"> Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Well, it was not with a view to that sort of future that he had
you called to the Bar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> At the Bar I could have earned my own living in about ten
years&mdash;possibly. When I had to give up marrying Th&eacute;r&egrave;se I saw how
useless I was. Thanks to her I found myself out. She gave me a bit of
her own courage. She woke up my self-respect. Besides, after that I had
something to work for, an aim, and I seemed to understand why I was
alive. I worked and read a lot; my firm noticed me; they sent me to
Tunis. I asked them to let me give up clerk work and have a try on my
own. Over there I got into touch with three small firms. I placed their
goods. I earn four hundred francs a month. Next year I mean to start a
little branch in this district where we will manufacture
superphosphates. From now until then I shall travel about the district
and try and get customers; and my wife&mdash;and Th&eacute;r&egrave;se&mdash;will go on with her
work here, if you will be so good as to keep her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Ouf! Think of a young man who can talk as long as that, without
taking breath, giving up the Bar. What a pity!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat</span> [<i>to Ren&eacute;</i>] Have you told all that to your people?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Yes. They're not at all proud of my business. And after refusing
to let me marry Th&eacute;r&egrave;se because she had no money they won't let me marry
her now because she works for her living. To be directress of a bindery,
even of your bindery, uncle, is not distinguished enough for them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Well, my boy, you certainly couldn't have stood up to things
like that a year ago. What d'you want us to do for you? Th&eacute;r&egrave;se doesn't
want our consent to marry; nor do you.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>While Monsieur F&eacute;liat has been speaking, old Mother Bougne
has come in from the right. She is a poor old workwoman who
walks with difficulty, leaning on a broom, from which one
feels that she never parts. She has a bunch of keys at her
waistbelt; her apron is turned up and makes a sort of pocket
into which she slips pieces of paper and scraps that she
picks up from the floor. Ren&eacute; looks at her with surprise.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> You're looking at Mother Bougne. Good-morning, Mother Bougne.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother Bougne.</span> Good-morning, Monsieur F&eacute;liat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> When does the Committee of your Union sit?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother Bougne.</span> On Wednesday, Monsieur F&eacute;liat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> You won't miss it, will you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother Bougne.</span> I haven't missed one up to now, Monsieur F&eacute;liat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> That's right. [<i>She goes out at the back during what follows.
Monsieur F&eacute;liat turns to Ren&eacute; and says</i>] We call Mother Bougne our
Minister of the Interior, because she tries to keep the place tidy.
She's been a weaver near Rouen since she was eight years old; she's been
stranded here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> And she's a member of the Committee of the Union?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Yes, she's a member. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se insisted on it. When Th&eacute;r&egrave;se
founded a Woman's Trade Union here she had the nice idea of including
among them this poor old creature, wrecked by misery and hard work. Our
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se has ideas like that. [<i>With a change of tone</i>] But business,
business. What do you want us to do for you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> I've come to ask you two things. The first is to try to get round
my people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Well, I'll try. But I know your father. He's even more obstinate
than I am myself. I shan't make the smallest impression upon him. What
else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> I want to have a talk with Th&eacute;r&egrave;se in your presence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> In our presence! Now listen, my boy. Our presence will be much
more useful in the work rooms. We have our hands full here. You've
dropped in just at the point of a split between workmen and employers.
Besides, to tell you the truth, I think I know pretty well what you have
to say to Th&eacute;r&egrave;se. I'll send her to you. And, look here, don't keep her
too long, because she's got her hands full too. [<i>To Gu&eacute;ret</i>] Will you
go and telephone to Duriot's?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret</span> [<i>looking at his watch</i>] Yes, there might be some news. [<i>He goes
out</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat</span> [<i>to Ren&eacute;</i>] And I'll send Th&eacute;r&egrave;se here.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>He goes out and Ren&eacute; is alone for a few moments. Then
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se comes in. They advance towards each other quietly.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> How do you do, Ren&eacute;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>in a low voice</i>] That'll do; don't, Ren&eacute; dear. [<i>She withdraws
gently from his embrace</i>] Don't. Let's talk. Have you seen your people?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Well, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, they won't come to our wedding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> They still refuse their consent?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> We can do without it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> But they refuse it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Yes. Forgive me, my dearest, for asking you to take just my own
self. Do you love me enough to marry me quite simply, without any
relations, since I leave my relations for your sake?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> My dear, we mustn't do that; we must wait.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> No, I won't wait. I won't lose the best time of my life, and years
of happiness, for the sake of prejudices I don't believe in. Do you
remember what you said to me the night we played <i>Barberine</i>? You were
splendid. You said: "Marry me all the same, in spite of my poverty."
[<i>She makes a movement to stop him</i>] Oh, let me&mdash;please let me go on! I
was only a miserable weakling then, I was frightened about the future.
But you roused me and set me going. If I'm a man now, it's to you I owe
it. Thanks to you I know how splendid it is to trust one's self and
struggle, and hope, and succeed. Now I can come to you and say: "I am
the man you wanted me to be, let us marry and live together." Oh,
together, together! How splendid it sounds! Do you remember how you said
that night long ago: "Let us conquer our place in the world together"?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Oh, Ren&eacute;! Ren&eacute;! We must wait!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Why? Why must we wait? What possible reason can you have for not
doing now what you wanted me to do a year ago? Don't you believe in me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Oh yes, yes. It's not that!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> What is it then? Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, you frighten me. It seems as if you were
hiding something from me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> No, no. What an idea!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Is it&mdash;oh, can it be that you don't love me so much?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Oh, Ren&eacute;, no, no. Don't think that for a moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> But you're not being straight with me. You're hiding something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Don't ask me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Th&eacute;r&egrave;se!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Oh, please don't ask me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Now, you know very well that's impossible. How can there be
secrets between us? You and I are the sort of people who are straight
with one another. I must have my share in everything that makes you
unhappy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Well, then, I must tell you. It's about your father and mother.
Oh, how I wish I needn't tell you. Ren&eacute;, while you've been away your
people have been dreadful to me. Your father came here to see me. He
wanted me to swear never to see you again&mdash;never. Of course I wouldn't.
When I refused to give in he said it was through worldly wisdom. He
said: "If he wasn't going to inherit my money, you wouldn't hang on to
him like this." He dared to say that to me, Ren&eacute;&mdash;your father whom I
have always wanted to respect and love. He thought that of me. And then
I swore to him, and I've sworn to myself, that I'll never marry you,
never, without his consent. I cannot be suspected of <i>that</i>. You
understand, don't you? The poorer I am the prouder I ought to be. [<i>She
bursts into tears</i>] My dear&mdash;my dear! How unhappy I am! How dreadfully
unhappy I am!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> My darling! [<i>He kisses her</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Don't, Ren&eacute;! I couldn't help telling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> you. But you understand,
my dearest, that we've got to wait until he knows me better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;</span> [<i>forcibly</i>] No. We will <i>not</i> wait.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I'll never break my word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> What d'you want us to wait for? A change of opinion that'll
probably never come. And our youth will go, we shall have spoilt our
lives. You want to send me back to Paris all alone and unhappy, to spend
long silent evenings thinking about you and suffering from not being
with you, while you, here, will be suffering in the same way, in the
same loneliness. And we love each other, and it absolutely depends only
on ourselves whether we shall change our double unhappiness for a double
joy. [<i>Changing his tone</i>] I can't stand it, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se. I've loved you for
two years, and all this last year I've toiled and slaved to win you.
[<i>Low and ardently</i>] I want you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Oh, hush, hush!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> I want you. You're the one woman I've loved in my life. My love
for you <i>is</i> my life. I can't give up my life. Listen: I have to be in
Paris this evening; are you going to let me leave you broken-hearted?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Do you think that I'm not broken-hearted?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> I shan't suffer any the less because I know that you're suffering
too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> It doesn't depend upon us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> It depends entirely upon us. Look here, if people refuse to let us
marry, our love for each other is strong enough to do without marriage.
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, come with me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Oh, Ren&eacute;, Ren&eacute;! What are you asking me to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Have you faith in me? Look at me. Do you think I'm sincere? Do you
think I'm an honest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> man? Do you think that, if people refuse to let us
go through a ridiculous ceremony together, our union will be any the
less durable? Is it the ceremony that makes it real? Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, come with
me. Come this evening; let's go together; let's love each other. Oh, if
you loved me as much as I love you, you wouldn't hesitate for a second.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Oh, don't say that, I implore you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> Then you don't trust me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I won't do it. I won't do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> What prevents you? You're absolutely alone, you have no relations.
You owe nothing to anybody. No one will suffer for your action. You've
already given a year of your life to the foolish prejudices of society.
You've shown them respect enough. First they prevented our marriage
because you were poor; now they want to prevent it because you work.
Thanks to you I have been able to assert myself and get free. My father
and mother can keep their money. I don't want it. Come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>in tears</i>] You're torturing me. Oh, my dear, you're making me
most unhappy. I could never do that, never. Don't be angry with me. I
love you. I swear that I love you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;.</span> I love you, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se. I swear that I love you. All my life is
yours. [<i>He breaks down</i>] Don't make me so unhappy. The more unhappy,
the more I love you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I couldn't do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delegate.</span> Our union is to fight the masters; yours is to fight us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> It does you no harm whatever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Not a very dangerous invasion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delegate.</span> You think not. Listen. I've just come down from Paris. Who
gave me my railway ticket? A woman. Who did I find behind the counter at
the Post Office? A woman. Who was at the end of the telephone wire? A
woman. I had to get some money; it was a woman who gave it to me at the
bank. I don't even speak of the women doctors and lawyers. And in
industry, like everywhere else, women want to supplant us. There are
women now even in the metal-working shops. Everyone has the right to
defend himself against competition. The workmen are going to defend
themselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Without troubling about the consequences. To take away a
woman's right to work is to condemn her to starvation or prostitution.
You're not competitors, you're enemies.</p>

that in asking you to do away with your Union we're speaking in your own
interest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Bah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delegate.</span> We don't want women to take lower wages than ours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I know the phrase. "Equal wages for equal work."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delegate.</span> That's absolutely just.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> The masters won't give those equal wages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delegate.</span> The women have a means of forcing them to; they can strike.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> We don't wish to employ those means.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delegate.</span> I beg your pardon, the women would consent at once. It's you
that prevent them, through the Union that you've started. Isn't that so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> That is so. But you know why.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delegate.</span> No, I do not know why.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Then I will tell you why. It is because the phrase only seems
to be just and generous. You know very well that here, at any rate, the
owner would not employ any more women if he had to pay them the same
wages he pays the men. And if they struck, he'd replace them by men.
Your apparent solicitude is only hypocrisy. In reality you want to get
rid of the women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delegate.</span> Well, I admit that. The women are not competitors; they're
enemies. In every dispute they'll take the side of the masters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> How d'you know that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delegate.</span> They've always done it, because women take orders by instinct.
They're humble, and docile, and easily frightened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Why don't you say inferiors, at once?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delegate.</span> Well, yes; inferiors, the majority of them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> If they're inferiors, it's only right that they should take
lower wages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delegate.</span> Oh, I didn't mean to say&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>interrupting him</i>] But it's not true&mdash;they are <i>not</i> your
inferiors. If they believe they are, it's because of the wrongs and
humiliations you've imposed on them for centuries. You men stick
together. Why are we not to do the same? If you start trade unions, why
may not we? As a matter of fact, as regards work, we're your equals. We
need our wages; and to get hold of the jobs that we're able to do we
offer our work at a cheaper rate than you do. That is competition; you
must protect yourselves from it. If you want no more competition, keep
your women at home and support them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delegate.</span> But that's precisely what we want: "The man in the workshop,
the woman in the home."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> If the mother is not at home nowadays, it's because the man is
in the saloon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delegate.</span> The men go to the saloons because they're tired of finding the
place badly kept and the supper not ready when they go home, and instead
of a wife a tired-out factory hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> D'you think it's to amuse themselves the women go to work?
Don't you suppose they prefer a quiet life in their own homes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delegate.</span> They've only got to stay there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> And who's to support them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delegate.</span> Their husbands!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> First they've got to have husbands. What about the ones who
have no husbands&mdash;the girls, the widows, the abandoned? Isn't it better
to give them a trade than to force them to take a lover? Some of them
want to leave off being obliged to beg for the help of a man. Can't you
see that for a lot of women work means freedom? Can you blame them for
demanding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> the right to work? That's the victory they're fighting for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delegate.</span> I'm not at all sure that that victory is a desirable one.
Indeed, I'm sure it is not. When you've succeeded in giving the woman
complete independence through hard work; when you have taken her
children from her and handed them over to a cr&egrave;che; when you've severed
her from her domestic duties and also from all domestic happiness and
joy, how d'you know she won't turn round and demand to have her old
slavery back again? The quietness and peace of her own home? The right
to care for her own husband and nurse her own child?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> But can't you see that it's just that that the immense majority
of women are demanding now? We want the women to stay at home just as
much as you do. But how are you going to make that possible? At present
the money spent on drink equals the total of the salaries paid to women.
So the problem is to get rid of drunkenness. But the middle classes
refuse to meet this evil straightforwardly because the votes which keep
them in power are in the pockets of the publicans; and you socialist
leaders refuse just as much as the middle classes really to tackle the
drink question because you're as keen for votes as they are. You've got
to look the situation in the face. We're on the threshold of a new era.
In every civilized country, in the towns and in the rural districts,
from the destitute and from the poor, from every home that a man has
deserted for drink or left empty because men have no longer the courage
to marry, a woman will appear, who comes out from that home and will sit
down by your side in the workshop, in the factory, at the office, in the
counting house. You don't want her as housewife; and as she refuses to
be a prostitute, she will become a woman-worker, a competitor; and
finally, because she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> has more energy than you have, and because <i>she</i>
is not a drunkard, she will take your places.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delegate</span> [<i>brutally</i>] Well, before another hour's gone over our heads
you'll find that she won't start that game here.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Monsieur F&eacute;liat comes in.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat</span> [<i>to the delegate</i>] My dear sir, a thousand pardons for
interrupting you, but as I've just turned your friend out of my house
because he took advantage of being in it to start a propaganda against
me, what's the use of your going on talking to this lady about a course
of action she will no more consent to than I shall?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delegate.</span> Very well, Monsieur. I shall telephone to Paris for
instructions. Probably you will refuse to let me use your instrument.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> I most certainly shall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delegate.</span> So I shall go to the Post Office, and in ten minutes&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Go, my dear sir, go. But let me tell you in a friendly way that
it'll take you more than ten minutes to get on to Paris.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delegate.</span> It takes you more, perhaps, but not me. Good-morning. [<i>The
delegate goes out</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat</span> [<i>to Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</i>] The low brute! Things are not going well. What
happened at Duriot's has made a very unfortunate impression here. The
news that you were going to open a new workshop for the women has been
twisted and distorted by gossip and chatter, and my men have been worked
up by the other brute to come and threaten me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> What d'you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> They threaten me with a strike and with blacklisting me if I
don't give up the idea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You can't give up absolutely certain profits.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> If I am too obstinate, it may result in much larger losses which
will be equally certain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> But what then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> I've had to promise that for the present at any rate there's no
question of taking on any more women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> What could I do?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Monsieur Gu&eacute;ret comes in.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat</span> [<i>to Gu&eacute;ret</i>] Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> They wouldn't listen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> I was afraid they wouldn't. [<i>To Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</i>] That's not all. Your
godfather has been trying something else, and I understand he's not
succeeded. I shall have to take the mending away from your workshop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> The women won't agree to that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Perhaps that would be the best solution of the difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>startled</i>] Don't say that. You can't mean it. Think!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> What's more, the men refuse to finish the work the women have
begun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> We'll finish it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Then they'll strike.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Let them strike. Monsieur F&eacute;liat, you can fight now and get
terms for yourself. Just at this moment we have only one very urgent
order. If the men strike, I can find you women to replace them. Every
day I am refusing people who want to be taken on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret</span> [<i>suddenly</i>] I have an idea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> What's that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> I know my men; they're not bad fellows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> My workers are splendid women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Of course they are. As a matter of fact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> we're face to face now,
not with a fight between men and masters, but with a fight between
men-workers and women-workers. The men have their trade union, and the
women have theirs. Both unions have a President and two Vice-Presidents.
Both have their office. We must have a meeting between the two here at
once, in a friendly, sensible way, before they've all had time to excite
themselves; and let them find some way out that'll please 'em all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> But, my dear fellow, if you bring them together, they'll tear
one another's eyes out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Oh, we know you don't believe the working classes have any
sense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat</span> [<i>between his teeth</i>] I don't. I've been an employer too long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>to Monsieur F&eacute;liat</i>] Why not try what my godfather suggests?
What do you risk?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> I don't mind. But I will have nothing to do with it personally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Neither will I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I'll go and see if Berthe and Constance are here. [<i>To Gu&eacute;ret</i>]
You go and fetch your men. [<i>She goes out to the left</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> I give you my word that, if there's any possible way out, this
is the only chance of getting at it.</p>

will you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berthe.</span> We do want the work so, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Constance.</span> It's God's truth we do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> I'll do everything possible on my side, but it all depends on

<p><span class="smcap">Deschaume.</span> We'd best have you, Girard. You've education, and you're up

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> It's not worth while.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deschaume.</span> Well, I only put it forrard because it's the usual. But have

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> Well, ladies&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent</span> [<i>interrupting</i>] Now look here. I want to get at an
understandin'.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Monsieur Girard, will you be kind enough to speak for your
friends? We have nothing to say on our part. We're asking for nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> Well, that's true. We want to have the mending back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> And we don't mean to give it up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> Well, we expected that. Now, to show you that we're not such a
bad lot as you think, we'll share it with you on two conditions. The
first is that you're paid the same wages as we are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deschaume.</span> Look here, that won't suit me at all, that won't. If my old
woman gets as much as me, how am I to keep her under? Blimey, she'll
think she's my bloomin' equal!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard</span> [<i>impatiently</i>] Oh, bung her into some other berth. Let me go on.
The second condition is that you aren't to have a separate workshop.
We'll all work together as we used to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deschaume.</span> You women do a damned sight too much for your ha'pence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> Yes, it's all in the interests of the masters. It's against
solidarity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Will you allow me to express my astonishment that you should
make conditions with us when you wish to take something from us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charpin.</span> We're ony tellin' you our terms for sharing the work with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> I quite understand; but we have no desire to share it with you.
We mean to keep it. And I'm greatly surprised to hear you suggest that
we should all work together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Constance.</span> Indeed we won't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deschaume.</span> Why not, Mademoiselle? When we worked together&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Constance</span> [<i>interrupting</i>] When we worked with you before, you played
all sorts of dirty tricks on us to make us leave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deschaume.</span> What tricks? Did you hear anything about that, Charpin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charpin.</span> I dunnow what she's talkin' about. D'you Vincent?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span> Look here, I only want to get to an understandin'.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Constance.</span> You never stopped sayin' beastly things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deschaume and Charpin</span> [<i>protesting together</i>] Oh! O-ho!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deschaume.</span> Well, if we can't have a bit of chippin' in a friendly way
like!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berthe.</span> Beastly things like that ain't jokes. I didn't know where to
look meself; and I've sat for a sculptor, so I ain't too particular.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charpin.</span> He! He! I thought she was talkin' about that old joke of the
rats.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The men laugh together.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes, you're laughing about it still! About shutting up live
rats in our desks before we came to work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> He! He! We didn't mean any harm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You didn't mean any harm! The little apprentice was ill for a
week, and Madame Dumont had a bad fall. You thought of dozens of things
of that kind, like the typists who mixed up all the letters on the
women's desks. When we went away to get our lunch, you came and spoilt
our work and made the women lose a great part of their day's pay or work
hours of overtime. We don't want any more of that. You agreed we should
have a separate workshop. We'll keep it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> If Monsieur F&eacute;liat sticks to you, we'll have to come out on
strike.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> We don't want Monsieur F&eacute;liat to get into trouble because of
us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> Well, what are you going to do about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> We'll take your places.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charpin</span> [<i>bringing his fist down with a bang upon the table</i>] Well, I'm
damned!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deschaume</span> [<i>threateningly</i>] If you do, we'll have to put you through it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Constance.</span> We'll do it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard</span> [<i>to Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</i>] D'you understand now, Mademoiselle, why we
socialists don't want women in the factory or in the workshop? The
woman's the devil because of the low salary she has to take. She's a
victim, and she likes to be a victim, and so she's the best card the
employer has to play against a strike. The women are too weak, and if I
might say so, too slavish&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deschaume.</span> Yes, that's the word, mate, slavish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berthe</span> [<i>very angry</i>] Look at that man there, my husband, and hear what
he's saying before me, his wife, that he makes obey him like a dog. He
beats me, he does. You don't trouble about my being what you call
slavish when it's you that profits by it! I'd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> like to know who taught
women to be slavish but husbands like you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You've so impressed it upon women that they're inferior to men,
that they've ended by believing it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> Well, maybe there's exceptions, but it's true in the main.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deschaume.</span> Let 'em stay at home, I says, and cook the bloomin' dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berthe.</span> And what'll they cook the days when you spend all your wages in
booze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> It's the people that started you working that you ought to
curse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berthe.</span> I like that! It was my husband himself that brought me to the
workshop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> She's not the only one, eh, Vincent?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span> But I ain't sayin' nothin', I ain't. What are you turnin' on me
for? I ain't sayin' nothin'.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berthe.</span> We'd like nothing better than to stay at home. Why don't you
support us there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Constance.</span> It's because you don't support us there that you've got to
let us work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deschaume.</span> We ain't going to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berthe.</span> We won't give in to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> If you don't, we'll turn the job in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> And I tell you that we shall take your places.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deschaume.</span> Rats! You can't do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> We couldn't at one time, that's true. But now we've got the
machines. The machines drove the women from their homes. Up to lately
one had to have a man's strength for the work; now, by just pulling a
lever, a woman can do as much and more than the strongest man. The
machines revenge us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deschaume.</span> We'll smash the things.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> She's right. By God, she's right! It's them machines has done
it. If any one had told my grandfather a time would come when one chap
could keep thousands of spindles running and make hundreds of pairs of
stockings in a day, and yards and yards of woollen stuff, and socks and
shirts and all, why grandfather'd've thought everybody'd have shirts and
socks and comforters and shoes, and there'd be no more hard work and
empty bellies. Curse the damned things! We works longer hours, and
there's just as many bare feet and poor devils shivering for want of
clothes. The machines were to give us everything, blast 'em! The workers
are rotten fools! The damned machines have made nothing but hate between
them that own them and them that work them. They've used up the women
and even the children; and it's all to sell the things they make to
niggers or Chinamen; and maybe we'll have war about it. They've made the
middle classes rich, and they're the starvation of all of us; and after
they've done all that, here are the women, our own women, want to help
'em to best us!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother Bougne.</span> You're right, Girard. When I was a kid, and there was no
machines&mdash;leastways, not to speak of&mdash;we was all better off. Women
stayed at home, and they'd got enough to do. Why, my old grandmother
used to fetch water from the well and be out pickin' up sticks before it
was light of a mornin'! Yes, and women made their own bread, and did
their washin', and made their bits of things themselves! Now it's
machines for everythin', and they say to us: "Come into the factory and
you'll earn big money." And we come, like silly kids! Why, fancy me,
eight years old, taken out of the village and bunged into a spinnin'
mill! Then, when I was married, there was me in a workman's dwellin'.
You turn a tap for your water, don't fetch it; baker's bread, and your
bit of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> dinner from the cookshop, or preserved meat out of a tin. You
don't make a fire, you turn on the gas; your stockin's and togs all
fetched out of a shop. There ain't no need for the women to stay at home
no longer, so they cuts down the men's wages and puts us in the
factories. We ain't got time to suckle our kids; and now they don't want
young 'uns any more! But when you're in the factory, they make yer pay
through the nose for yer gas and yer water, and baker's bread and
ready-made togs; and you've got nothin' left out of yer bit of wages,
and you're as poor as ever; and you're only a "hand" at machines in the
damp and smoke, instead of bein' in your own house an' decent like. What
are you fussin' about, Girard? Don't you see that we <i>can't</i> go back to
the old times now? A woman ain't got a house now, only a little room
with nothin' but a dirty bed to sleep on! And I tell you, Girard, you've
got to let us earn our livin' like that now, because it's you and the
likes of you that's brought us to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> Well, after all, we've got to look after our living. The women
want to take it from us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother Bougne.</span> It's because they haven't got any themselves, my lad.
They've got to live as well as you, you see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> And supposing there isn't enough living for everybody?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother Bougne.</span> The strongest'll get it and the weak 'uns'll be done in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> Well, we've not made the world, and we're not going to have our
work taken away from us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Constance.</span> And we're not, either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deschaume.</span> Damn it all, we've got to live.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berthe.</span> Well, we've got to live too. The kids has got to live and we've
got to live. One would think we was brute beasts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Constance.</span> We say just the same as you. We've not made the world, it
ain't our fault.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charpin.</span> We want you to sack all the women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deschaume.</span> No we don't. We want you to sack Mademoiselle Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> You're mad! What harm has she done you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> The harm she's done us? Well, she's on your side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deschaume.</span> She's turned the women's heads. They want to take our places.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Come! Be reasonable. You can't ask me that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> We <i>do</i> ask you that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Well, I must have time to think about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> There's nothing to think about. Sack the Paris woman or we go on
strike.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> You can't put a pistol to my head like this. I've got orders in
hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> What's that to us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Well then, I won't give in this time. You demanded that I should
not open a new workshop. I gave in. I won't go further than that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> Then out we go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Well go, and be damned to you. [<i>Pause</i>] The women will take
your places.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> You think so, do you? You think it's as easy as that. Well, try.
Just you try to fill up our places. Have you forgot there's two
delegates here from the Central Committee? A phone to Paris and your
bally show is done for.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> It's damnable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> And if that doesn't choke you off, there's other things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charpin.</span> We'll set the whole bloomin' place on fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> Don't you try to bully us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Well, look here. We won't quarrel. I'll send away Mademoiselle
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se. But give me a little time to settle things up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charpin.</span> No; out she goes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Give me a month. I ask only a month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> An hour, that's all you'll get, an hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charpin.</span> An hour, not more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girard.</span> We're going off to meet the delegates at the Hotel de la Poste;
you can send your answer there. The Parisian goes out sharp now, or else
look out for trouble. Come on, boys, let's go and tell the others.
There's nothing more to do here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> But stop, listen&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charpin</span> [<i>to F&eacute;liat</i>] That's our last word. [<i>To the others</i>] Hurry on.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The workmen go out. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se has come in a moment before and
is standing on the threshold.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat</span> [<i>to Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</i>] How much did you hear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Oh, please, please, don't give in. Don't abandon these women.
It's dreadful in the workroom. They're in despair. I've just been with
them, talking to them. They get desperate when they think of their
children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> The men are not asking me now to get rid of them. What they're
asking for is the break-up of your Union, and that you yourself should
go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Oh, they say that now. But if you give in, they'll see that
they can get anything they like from your weakness, and they'll make you
turn out all these wretched women.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> But I can't help myself! You didn't hear the brutal threats of
these men. If I don't give in, I shall be blacklisted, and they'll set
the place on fire; they said so. Where will your women's work be then?
And I shall be ruined.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Then you mean to give in without a struggle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Would <i>you</i> like to take the responsibility for what will happen
if I resist? There'll be violence. Just think what it'll mean. In the
state the men are in anything may happen. There's a wounded man already.
How many would there be to-morrow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You think only of being beaten. But suppose you win? Suppose
you act energetically and get the best of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> My energy would be my ruin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>with a change of tone</i>] Then you wish me to go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> I have only made up my mind to it to prevent something worse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>very much moved</i>] It's impossible you can sacrifice me in this
way at the first threat. Look here, Monsieur F&eacute;liat; perhaps it doesn't
come very well from me, but I can't help reminding you that you've said
repeatedly yourself that I've been extremely useful to you. Don't throw
me overboard without making one try to save me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> It would be no use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> How can you tell? It's your own interest to keep me. The
delegate said that if I go they'll break up the Women's Union and make
the women take the same wages as the men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> They won't do that because they know I wouldn't keep them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You see! If you give in, it means the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> break-up of the whole
thing and the loss to you of the saving I've made for you. And you have
obligations to these women who have been working for you for years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> If I have to part with them, I will see they are provided for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes, for a day&mdash;a week, perhaps. But afterwards? What then?
Little children will be holding out their hands for food to mothers who
have none to give them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> But, good God, what have <i>I</i> to do with that? Is it my fault?
Don't you see that I'm quite powerless in the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> No, you're not quite powerless. You can choose which you will
sacrifice, the women who have been perfectly loyal to you, or the men
who want to wring from your weakness freedom from competition which
frightens them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> They're fighting for their daily bread.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes, fighting the woman because she works for lower wages. She
can do that because she is sober and self-controlled. Is it because of
her virtues that you condemn her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> I know all that as well as you do, and I tell you again the
women can go on working just as they were working before you came.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> You'll be made to part with them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> We shall see. But at present that's not the question. The
present thing is about you. One of us has to be sacrificed, you or me. I
can see only one thing. If I stick to you, my machinery will be smashed
and my works will be burned. I'm deeply sorry this has happened, and I
don't deny for a moment the great value of your services; but, after
all, I can't ruin myself for your sake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>urgently</i>] But you <i>wouldn't</i> be ruined.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> Defend yourself,
take measures. Ask for assistance from the Government.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> The Government can't prevent the strike.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> But the women will do the work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> You think of nothing but your women. And the men? They'll be

with them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>almost in tears</i>] And me, you have no pity for me. What's to
become of me? If you abandon me, I'm done for. I'd made a career for
myself. I had realized my dreams. I was doing a little good. And I was
so deeply grateful to you for giving me my chance. I'm all alone in the
world, you know that very well. Before I came here I tried every
possible way to earn my living. Oh, please don't send me away. Don't
drive me back into that. Try once again, do something. Let me speak to
the men. It's all my life that's at stake. If you drive me out, I don't
know where to go to.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Monsieur Gu&eacute;ret comes in.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret</span> [<i>greatly excited</i>] F&eacute;liat, we mustn't wait a moment; we must
give in at once. They're exciting themselves; they're mad; they're
getting worse; they may do anything. They've gone to the women's
workroom and they're driving them out.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>From the adjoining workshop there comes a crash of glass
and the sound of women screaming.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>desperately</i>] Go, Monsieur! Go quickly! Don't let anything
dreadful happen. You're right. I'll leave at once. Go!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Monsieur Gu&eacute;ret and Monsieur F&eacute;liat rush into the women's
workshop. The noise increases; there is a sound of furniture
overthrown and the loud screams of women.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Th&eacute;r&egrave;se stands as if hypnotized by terror, her eyes wide
open and fixed upon the door of the workshop. The noise
still increases; there is a revolver shot, then a silence.
Finally the voice of Monsieur F&eacute;liat is heard speaking,
though the words are not intelligible, and a shout of men's
voices. Then Monsieur Gu&eacute;ret comes in very pale.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Don't be frightened, it's all over. The shot was fired in the
air. The men have gone out; there are only the women now&mdash;crying in the
workshop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Are you sure nobody is killed? Is it true, oh, tell me, is it
really true?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Monsieur F&eacute;liat comes in.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Poor Th&eacute;r&egrave;se! Don't be frightened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Oh, those screams! Those dreadful screams! Is it true, really,
nobody was hurt?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Nobody, I assure you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> The shot?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> Fired in the air, to frighten the women. The men broke in the
door, and upset a bench, and made a great row. I got there just in time.
As soon as they were promised what they want they were quiet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</span> [<i>after a pause, slowly</i>] They were promised what they want. So
it's done. [<i>A silence</i>] Then there's nothing left for me but to go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;ret.</span> Where are you going to?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> You needn't go at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> Yes, I'm going at once. [<i>A silence</i>] I'm going where I'm
forced to go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F&eacute;liat.</span> You can leave to-morrow or the day after.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.</span> No, I leave by train, this evening, for Paris.</p>

<h2>ACT I</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>:&mdash;<i>The first inner court of the house of Rheou. At the back
between two lofty pylons the entrance leading up from below. Through the
columns supporting the hanging garden which stretches across the back
can be seen the Nile. A high terrace occupies the left of the scene.
Steps lead up to it, and from there to the hanging garden. Along the
side of the terrace a small delicately carved wooden statue of Isis
stands on a sacrificial table. On the right is the peristyle leading to
the inner dwelling of Akhounti. The bases of the columns are in the form
of lotus buds, the shafts like lotus stems, the capitals full blown
flowers. In the spaces between the columns are wooden statues of the
gods.</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Delethi is playing a harp. Nagaou dances before her. Nahasi is juggling
with oranges, while Mouene sits watching a little bird in a cage. Yaouma
reclines on the terrace supporting her head on her elbows and gazing out
at the Nile. Zaya is beside her. On a carpet Sitsinit, lying flat upon
her stomach with a writing box by her side, is busy painting an ibis on
the left hand of Hanou, who lies in a similar attitude.</i></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Sitsi.</span> Did you not know? She, on whose left hand a black ibis has been
painted, is certain of a happy day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hanou.</span> A happy day! Why then, 'tis I, perhaps, who will be chosen
to-night!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delethi</span> [<i>playing the harp while Nagaou dances before her</i>] More
slowly!&mdash;more slowly!... you must make them think of the swaying of a
lotus flower, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> the Nile's slow-moving current would bear away, and
that raises itself to kiss again the waters of the stream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nagaou.</span> Yes, yes.... Begin again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nahasi</span> [<i>juggling with oranges</i>] Nagaou would let herself be borne away
without a struggle. [<i>She laughs</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouene</span> [<i>hopping on one foot</i>] We know that she goes to the bank of the
Nile, at the hour when the palm-trees grow black against the evening
sky, to listen to a basket maker's songs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hanou</span> [<i>to Sitsinit</i>] And this morning I anointed my whole body with
Kyphli, mixed with cinnamon and terrabine and myrrh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delethi</span> [<i>to Nagaou</i>] 'Tis well ... you may dance the great prayer to
Isis with the rest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nagaou</span> [<i>to Mouene</i>] Yes! I do go to listen to songs at dark. You are
still too little for anyone, basket maker or any other, to take notice
of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouene.</span> You think so!... who gave me this little bird? [<i>She draws the
bird from the cage by a string attached to its leg</i>] Who caught thee,
flower-of-the-air, who gave thee to me? [<i>Holding up a finger</i>] Do not
tell! Do not tell....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hanou</span> [<i>looking at herself in a metal mirror</i>] Sitsinit ... the black
line that lengthens this eye is too short ... make it longer with your
reed. I think the more beautiful I am, the more chance I shall have to
be chosen for the sacrifice.... Is it not so, Zaya?... What are you
doing there without a word?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zaya.</span> I was watching the flight of a crane with hanging feet, that
melted away in the distant blue of heaven.... Do not hope to be chosen
by the gods, Hanou.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hanou.</span> Wherefore should I not be chosen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zaya.</span> Neither you nor any who are here. The gods never demand the
sacrifice two years together from the same village.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hanou.</span> Never?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zaya.</span> Rarely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hanou.</span> 'Tis a pity. Is it not, Nagaou?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nagaou.</span> I know not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sitsi.</span> Would it not make you proud?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nagaou.</span> Yes. But it makes me proud, too, to lean on the breast of him
whose words still the beating of my heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delethi.</span> To be taken by a god! By the Nile!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hanou.</span> Preferred to all the others!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouene</span> [<i>the youngest</i>] For my part I should prefer to live....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sitsi.</span> Still, if the God desired you....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zaya.</span> Oh! one can refuse....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delethi.</span> Yes, but one must leave the country, then.... None of the
daughters of Haka-Phtah could bring themselves to that.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>A pause.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma</span> [<i>to herself</i>] Perhaps!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nahasi.</span> What do you say, Yaouma?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> Nothing. I was speaking to my soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouene.</span> Yaouma's eyes weep for weariness because they watch far off for
him, who comes not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> Peace, child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zaya</span> [<i>to Delethi</i>] One thing is certain, someone must go upon the
sacred barge?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delethi.</span> Without the sacrifice the Nile would not overflow, and all the
land would remain barren.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hanou.</span> And the corn would not sprout, nor the beans, nor the maize, nor
the lotus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delethi.</span> And all the people would perish miserably.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hanou.</span> So that she who dies, sacrificed to the Nile, saves the lives of
a whole people. That is a better thing, Nagaou, than to make one man's
happiness.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>A pause.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma</span> [<i>to herself</i>] Perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hanou.</span> And on the appointed day one is borne from the house of the god
to the Nile, surrounded by all the dwellers in the town.... The
Pharaoh&mdash;health and strength be unto him!...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delethi.</span> You do not know, Hanou, you tell us what you do not know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hanou.</span> But it is so, is it not, Zaya? Zaya knows about the ceremony,
because last year it was her sister who was chosen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouene.</span> Tell us, Zaya.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nahasi.</span> Yes, tell us the manner of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zaya.</span> On the fifth day of the month of Paophi....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouene.</span> To-day&mdash;that is to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nahasi.</span> Yes. What will happen.... The prayer of Isis.... But afterwards?
Before?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>They gather round Zaya.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Zaya.</span> Before the sun has ended his day's journey, the people, summoned
to the terraces by a call from the Temple, will intone the great hymn to
Isis, which is sung but once a year. Within the house of the god the
assembled priests will await the sign that shall reveal the virgin to be
offered to the Nile to obtain its yearly flood. The name of the chosen
will be cried from the doorway on high, caught up by those who hear it
first, cried out to others, who in turn will cry it running towards the
house that Ammon has favored with his choice. Then shall the happy
victim of the year stand forth alone, amid her kinsfolk bowed before
her, and to her ears shall rise the shoutings of the multitude.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delethi.</span> And after a month of purification she will be borne to the
house of the god!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zaya.</span> And on the day of Prodigies....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nahasi.</span> Oh, the day of Prodigies!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zaya.</span> She will be the foremost nearer to the Sanctuary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> than all the
rest. She will pray with the praying crowd, she will behold the lowering
of the stone that hides the face of Isis....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delethi.</span> She will behold Isis&mdash;face to face....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zaya.</span> She will beg the goddess graciously to incline her head, in sign
that, yet another year, Egypt shall be protected. And when the fervor of
the crowd's united prayer is great enough, the head of the Goddess of
Stone will bow. That will be the first prodigy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delethi.</span> The head of the Goddess of Stone will bow&mdash;that will be the
first prodigy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zaya.</span> And in the crowd there will be blind who shall see, and deaf who
shall hear, and dumb who shall speak.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delethi.</span> Perhaps Mieris, our good mistress, will be cured of her
blindness at last.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hanou.</span> And when she who is chosen goes forth from the house of the
God.... Tell us, Zaya, tell us the manner of her going forth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zaya.</span> Three days before the appointed day, in the town and throughout
the land, they will begin the preparations for the festival. When the
moment comes, the crowd will surge before the temple, guarded by Lybian
soldiers. And she, she, the elect, the saviour, will come forth, ringed
by the high priests of Ammon in purple and in gold, and aloft on a
chariot where perfumes burn, deafened by sound of trumpet and cries of
joy, she will behold the people stretch unnumbered arms to her....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delethi.</span> And she will be borne to the Nile....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zaya.</span> And she will be borne to the Nile. She will board the barge of
Ammon....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delethi.</span> And the barge will glide from the bank....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zaya.</span> And the barge will glide from the bank where all the crowd will
bow their faces to the dust. [<i>She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> stops, greatly moved</i>] And when the
barge returns she will be gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> [<i>in low tones</i>] And when the barge returns she will be gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zaya.</span> And after two days the waters of the Nile will rise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span> The waters of the Nile will rise....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delethi.</span> And as far as the waters flow they will speak her name, who
made the sacrifice, with blessings and with tears.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hanou.</span> If it were I!...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> [<i>save Yaouma</i>] If it were I!...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouene</span> [<i>mischievously</i>] I know why! I know why!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> Yes.</p>

bearing the travellers from the North. There is a young priest among
them, the potter's son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> He is my betrothed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nahasi.</span> But you know what they say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zaya.</span> They say that on the same boat there comes a scribe who preaches
of new gods....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delethi.</span> Of false gods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouene.</span> The priests will stop the boat, and eight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> days hence, perhaps,

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> The call of the Gods is death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> The God has chosen me, before all he has preferred me. He has
preferred me to those who are fairer, to those who are richer. And I

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> I die to bring the flooding of the Nile&mdash;to make fertile all the

will be a byword wherever the rays of the sun-God fall. Another than I
will go clothed in the dazzling robe. Another will hear the shouting of

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Another will die, and you, you will live, for your own joy and

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> For my own shame and for yours.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> The waves of the Nile will be my head-dress. Oh! fair green
robe, with flowers yet more fair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Yaouma, you loved me&mdash;[<i>She bends her head</i>] Remember, remember
my going away, but two years since, how you did weep when I embarked.
You ran by the bank, you followed the boat that bore me. I see you
still, the slim form, the swift lank limbs; I can hear still the sound
of your little naked feet upon the sand. And when the boat grounded&mdash;do
you remember? For hours the oarsmen pushed with long poles, singing the
while, and you clapping your hands and crying out my name. And when at
length we floated, there was laughter and cries of joy&mdash;but you, you did
stand all on a sudden still, and I knew then that you wept. You climbed
to a hillock, and you waved your arms, you grew smaller, smaller,
smaller, till we turned by a cluster of palms. Oh, how you promised to
wait for me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> Have I not waited?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> We had chosen the place to build our home. Do you remember?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> And dreamed of nights when you should sleep with your head upon
my breast&mdash;[<i>Yaouma bends her head</i>] And now you seek a grave in the
slime of the river.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma</span> [<i>with fervor</i>] The slime of the river is holy, the river is
holy. The Nile is nine times holy. It makes grow the pasture that feeds
our flocks. It drinks the tears of all our eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Listen, Yaouma, I will reveal the truth to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> you. The Gods who
claim your sacrifice&mdash;the Gods are false.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> The Gods are true&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> They are powerless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> It is their power that subdues me&mdash;it is stronger than love.
Until to-day I loved you more than all the living things upon the
earth&mdash;the breath of your mouth alone gave life to my heart. Even this
very day, I dreaded being chosen of the Gods. But now, who has so
utterly transformed me if it be not the Gods? You are to me as nothing,
now. And I who trembled at a scorpion, who wept at the pricking of a
thorn, I am all joy at the thought of dying soon. How could this be if
the Gods had not willed it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Hear me a little&mdash;and I can prove to you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> No words can take away the glory of being chosen by the Gods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> By the priests.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> 'Tis the same, the priests are the voice of the Gods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> 'Tis they who say so. The Gods of Egypt exist only because men
have invented them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> The peoples from whose lands you come have made you lose your
reason. [<i>With a smile of pity</i>] Say that our Gods exist not! Think,
Satni!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Neither the Gods, nor the happy fields, nor the world to come,
nor hell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> Ah! Ah! I will prove you mad&mdash;you say there is no hell&mdash;But we
know, we know that it exists, look there! [<i>Pointing to the sunset</i>]
When the sun grows red at evening, is it not because the glow of hell is
thrown upon it from below? You have but to open your eyes. [<i>Laughing</i>]
The Gods not exist!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> They do not. In the sanctuaries of our temples is nothing save
beasts, unclean, absurd, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> lifeless images; believe me, Yaouma&mdash;I
love you&mdash;I will not see you die. Your sacrifice is useless. Not because
you are offered up will the waters of the Nile rise! Refuse, hide
yourself, the waters will still rise. Ah, to lose you for a lie! To lose
you&mdash;you! How can I convince you?&mdash;I know! Yaouma, you saw me cross the
dead scarabs on my path. And yet I live! Oh! it angers me to see my
words move you not. Your reason, your reason! Awaken your reason&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> I am listening to my heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> I will save you in spite of you&mdash;I will keep you by force&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> If you do, I shall hate you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> I do not know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> You are mistaken perhaps. Did you go down as far as the Nile?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> Yes, master.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> They have finished the decoration of the sacred barge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> I do not understand it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> Nor I, for I know that a certain number of the soldiers have
refused to renew the attempt of yesterday&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> They have refused?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> What did they say?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> That they were afraid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> Of Satni.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> Of Satni?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> Yes. They say it was he who caused the miracle of yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> What&mdash;what do they say? Their words&mdash;tell me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> That it was he&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> He, Satni?&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> Who caused the miracle of yesterday?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> The miracle that prevented them from carrying out the order of

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> The order to come here and seize Yaouma?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> So that is what they say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> Every one says it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou</span> [<i>after some reflection</i>] Come, it is time you learned the truth,
that you may repeat it all. In the countries whither he went Satni
learned many things&mdash;great things. Come hither, lend your ear. He
declares there be other gods than the gods of Egypt&mdash;and more powerful.
If you remember, my father and the Pharaoh Amenotep likewise declared
this, and would have made these gods known to us. How they were
frustrated you know. It seems&mdash;for my own part I know not, 'tis Satni
says so, ceaselessly, these two months since his return&mdash;it seems then,
the time is come when these Gods would make them known to us. They have
endowed Satni with superhuman power. That I <i>know</i>, and none may doubt
it now. Satni is resolved to keep his betrothed, and the Lybian Guards
were not deceived, it was he who yesterday called down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> the thunder and
the floods from Heaven upon the soldiers sent here to seize Yaouma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> The oldest remember but one such prodigy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> What I have told you, tell to all; and this, besides, say to
them: each time that any would cross the will of Satni&mdash;they who dare
the attempt will be scattered, even as the guards were scattered
yesterday. Add this, that Satni is guided by the spirit of the dead
Pharaoh, that I last night beheld my father's spirit, and that great
events will come to pass in Egypt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> I shall tell them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> Behold, the envoy of the new gods! Leave me to speak with him.
Go, repeat my words.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Steward goes out.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Satni enters from the back. Rheou prostrates himself before
Satni.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni</span> [<i>looking behind him</i>] Before which God do you still bow down?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> Before you. If you be not a God, you are the spirit of a God.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> I do not understand your words.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> Who can call down thunderbolts from heaven, unless he be an envoy
of the Gods?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> I am no&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> 'Tis well, 'tis well. You would have us blind to your power of
working miracles. After yesterday you can hide it no more. Henceforth,
Satni, you must no longer confine your teaching to Mieris, to me, to
your parents, Yaouma, to a few&mdash;henceforth you may speak to all, all
ears are opened by this miracle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Let us leave that! I pray you rise and tell me rather what has
befallen Yaouma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> Yaouma!&mdash;Did she not at first interpret the thunderclap as sign
of the wrath of Ammon against her?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> She believes still in Ammon, then, despite all I have said to
her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> Happily I undeceived her. I made her understand that 'twas you
the elements obeyed, that the thunder that frighted her, was but a sign
of your power.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Why should you lie to her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> It was not wholly lying. Besides, it was fortunate I could thus
explain the event. Had you but seen her&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> All my efforts of these two months past, in vain!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> You remember when you left us yesterday. You might have thought
that all her superstitions were banished at last. She no longer answered
you, she questioned you no more, and at your last words her silence
confirmed the belief that at length you had won her away from Ammon. Yet
after you were gone, at the moment of entering her hiding place, she was
swept with sudden fury as though an evil spirit had entered her, wept,
cried and tore her hair&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> What said she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> "To the temple! to the temple! I would go to the temple! The God
has chosen me! The God awaits me! Egypt will perish!" In short, words of
madness. She would have killed herself!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Killed herself!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> We had to put constraint on her. And 'twas only when I led her to
this terrace, after the thunderbolt, and pointed out the scattered
soldiery, that she came to herself, that at length she perceived that
your God was the most powerful. "What," she cried, "'tis he, he, my
Satni, who shakes the heavens and the earth for me! For me!" she
murmured, "for me!" She would have kissed your sandals, offered you a
sacrifice, worshipped, adored you. See where she comes, with Mieris!
Stay.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris,</span> Yes. He made her drink a liquid wherein no doubt a good genius
was hidden, and the evil spirit that tormented her was driven forth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou</span> [<i>credulously</i>] Is't possible?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> Every one saw it. And Kitoui&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> Kitoui, the cripple, went this morning to draw water from the
Nile, before all her neighbors who marvelled and cried with joy. And she
had merely touched the hem of his garment, even without his knowing it.
He has healed the child of Riti, too, he knows gods more powerful than
ours&mdash;younger gods, perhaps, our gods are so old&mdash;If it were not so, how
could he have walked unscathed the road where the scarabs lay, that day
when he came home? Since then, men have seen him do a thousand forbidden
things, have seen him defy our gods by disrespect. Without the
protection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> of a higher power, how could he escape the chastisement
whereof another had died? Who are his gods? Rheou, he must make them
known to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> He refuses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> For what reason?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> The reason he gives is absurd&mdash;he says there are no gods&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> No gods! no gods!&mdash;he is mocking you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> He is bound to secrecy, perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> Rheou, know you that this Ahmarsti&mdash;these two years now, on the
day of Prodigies, have I heard her at my side howling prayers at the
goddess that were never answered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> I know. Satni declares he could have healed all whom the goddess
has relieved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris</span> [<i>to herself</i>] He relieves even those women whom she
abandons&mdash;[<i>After a pause</i>] He must teach you the words that work these
miracles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> He refuses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> Force him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> He says there are none.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> Threaten him with death&mdash;he will speak.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris</span> [<i>with excitement</i>] But you do not understand me!&mdash;he has healed
Ahmarsti, he has healed Kitoui, wherefore should he not heal me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou</span> [<i>sadly</i>] Ah! Mieris, Mieris, think you I waited for your prayer,
to ask him that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> Well&mdash;Well&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> I could gain nothing but these words from him: "Could I overcome
the evil Mieris suffers from, even now should she rejoice in the
splendor of day."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> Nothing is impossible to the gods, even to ours; how much more
then to his!&mdash;He did not yield to your prayers!&mdash;Insist, order,
threaten! Force him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> to speak. You have the right to command him. He is
but the son of a potter after all. Let him be whipped till he yield. Do
anything, have him whipped to the point of death&mdash;or better, offer him
fields, the hill of date-trees that is ours; offer him our flocks, and
my jewels and precious stones&mdash;tell him we know him for a living
god&mdash;but I would be healed. I would be healed! I would see! See! [<i>With
anger</i>] Ah! you know not the worth of the light, you whose eyes are
filled with it! You cannot picture my misery, you who suffer it not! You
grieve for me, I doubt not, but you think you have done enough, having
given me pity!&mdash;No, no, I am wrong&mdash;I am unjust. But forgive me; this
thought that I might be healed has made me mad. Rheou!&mdash;Think, Rheou,
what it means to be blind, to have been so always, and to know that
beside one are those who see&mdash;who see!&mdash;The humblest of our shepherds,
the most wretched of the women at our looms, I envy them. And when, at
times, I hear them complain, I curb myself lest I should strike them,
wretches that know not their good fortune. I feel that all you, you who
see, should never cease from songs of joy, and hymns of thanksgiving to
the gods&mdash;[<i>With an outburst</i>] I speak of sight! Think, Rheou, I have
not even a clear idea of what it means "to see." To recognize without
touch, to know without need to listen. To perceive the sun another way
than by the heat of its rays!&mdash;They say the flowers are so beautiful!&mdash;I
would see <i>you</i>, my well-beloved. Oh! the day when I shall see your
eyes!&mdash;I would see, that you may show me some likeness of the little
child we lost. You shall point out, among the rest, those that are most
like to him. This misery&mdash;O my beloved!&mdash;I do not often speak of it&mdash;but
I suffer it! I suffer it! [<i>She is in his arms</i>] They have taken from me
the hope that our gods will heal me, if they give me nothing in its
place,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> know you what I shall do?&mdash;I shall go away, alone, one night,
touching the walls, and the trees&mdash;and the trees, with my arms
outstretched; I shall go down as far as the Nile and there, gently, I
shall glide away to death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> Peace, O my best beloved!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris</span> [<i>listening</i>] I hear him&mdash;he comes. I leave you with him! Lead

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> What do they want of you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> They came here, following me. They believe me gifted with

a juggler. I am neither, and I work no miracles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> None the less you have worked two miracles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Not one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> And you will work yet one more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Never. I came hither not to perform miracles, but to prevent
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> You will heal Mieris.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> No one can heal her, nor I, nor any other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> Give her a little hope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> How can I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> Tell her you will invoke your God, and that some day perhaps&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> I have no God. If there be a god, he is so great, so far from as,
so utterly beyond our comprehension, that for us it is as though he did
not exist. To believe that one of our actions, to believe that a prayer
could act upon the will of God, is to belittle him, to deny him. He is
himself incapable of a miracle; it would be to belie himself. Could he
improve his work, he would not then have created it perfect from the
first. He could not do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> Our ancient gods at least permitted hope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Keep them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> In the heart of Mieris, you have destroyed them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Do you regret it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> Not yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> What would you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> Even if it be true that sight will never be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> given her, do not
tell her so. Far better promise that she will be healed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> And to all the others, must I promise healing too? Because in a
house I relieved a child, whose illness sprang from a cause I could
remove; because a woman, ill in imagination, did cure herself by
touching my garment's hem; must I then descend to play the part of
sorcerer? I had behind me there, but now, a rabble of the wretched
imploring me, believing me all powerful, begging for them and theirs
unrealizable miracles. Should I then cheat them too, all those poor
wretches, promising what I know I cannot give? I came hither to make an
end of lies, not to replace them with others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou</span> [<i>with passion</i>] Ah! You would not lie. You would not lie to the
wretched. You would not lie to Mieris. You would lie to no one, is it
so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheou.</span> We shall see! [<i>Calling right</i>] Yaouma!&mdash;Let them send Yaouma!

not, then, I could see nothing. But the day of your return, when you

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> The truth&mdash;is the truth good only for the rich? Will you add that
injustice to all the others? Behold them! [<i>Gradually the slaves and
workers of all kinds have entered till they fill the stage. Amongst them
Pakh, Sokiti, Bitiou the Dwarf</i>] Yes, behold them, the victims, behold
the wretched! I know you all. You, you are shepherd, you are worse
nourished than your flocks, and your beasts, at least, are not given
blows. They do not beat the cows nor the sheep. You, you sow and you
reap; beneath the sun, tortured by flies, you gather abundant crops. You
sleep in a hole. Others eat the corn you made grow, and sleep on
precious stuffs. You, you are forever drawing water from the Nile;
betwixt you and the ox they harness to another machine, there is no
difference, and yet you are a man. You, you are one of those who drag
great stones, to build the monuments of pride. You are a digger in the
tombs, you live a month or more without sight of day. To glorify the
death of others, you give your life. You are a trainer of lions for war;
your father was eaten&mdash;they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> would have wept had the lion died&mdash;How can
it be that you accept all this, when you see beside you happiness
without work, and abundance without effort? I will tell you. 'Tis
because, in the name of the god Ammon-Ra, they have said to you: "Have
patience, this injustice will last but a life-time." Fools! nothing but
that! All the time you are on earth, suffer, produce for others. Content
ye with hunger, you who produce food. Content ye with worse usage than
the swine, you who have guard of them. Content ye to sleep in the open,
you who build palaces and temples. Content ye with all miseries, you
carvers of gold, and setters of precious stones. Look without envy,
without anger, on the welfare of those who do nothing, all this will
last only the whole of your lives! After, in another world, you shall
have the fulness of all the crops, and the joy of all the pleasures.
Well, they lied to you: there is no island of souls, there are no happy
fields, there is no life of atonement after this. [<i>Loud murmurs</i>] They
have set up these gods for your servile adoration; they have counselled
you: "Bow down, these gods will avenge you." They have said: "Prostrate
yourselves, these gods are just." They have said: "Throw yourselves to
earth, these gods are good." They have declared them all powerful; shut
them in sanctuaries of awful gloom, whence you are shown them once a
year, to keep alive your terror of the Gods; and last, they have made
you believe no man may touch these images and live. I tell you they
lied&mdash;I will show you they lied to you. Behold the most mighty
Ammon&mdash;the father of the gods&mdash;I spit my hate at him! Thou art but an
idol; I curse thee for evil men have done in thy name! I curse thee in
the name of all the enslaved, in the name of all those they have cheated
with hopes of an avenging life; in the name of all who for thousands of
years have groaned and wept; suffered insult, outrage, blows, death,
without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> thought of revolt, because promises made in thy name had
soothed their rage to sleep! And I curse thee for the sorrow that now
fills me, and for the ills that must come even of thy going! Die! [<i>He
throws a stool in the face of the statue</i>] You others do as I. Go, climb
their pedestals! Lay hold of their hands, they are lifeless! Strike,
'tis but an image! Spit in their faces, they are senseless! Strike!
Ruin! All this is nothing but hardened mud!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The crowd which had punctuated the words of Satni with

everything&mdash;You, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> can see her, behold this little image, think how
many tears were shed before her, in the years since she was made. She
has been ours for generations. Call up the countless crowds of those who
have fixed their anxious looks upon her eyes, dead even as mine are. It
is for all the anguish she has looked upon, we must respect her. Tears
make holy. I doubt not you are right: she must be broken too&mdash;but not
without farewell. [<i>To Yaouma</i>] Where is she, Yaouma? I would say my
last prayer to her. [<i>To the statue</i>] Oh, them who didst not heal, but
didst console me; O thou who hast heard so many entreaties and
thanksgivings, thou art but clay! Yet men have given thee life; thy life
was not in thee, it was in them&mdash;and the proof is that thou diest, now
they have taken their soul from thee. I give thee over to those who
would break thee, but I revere thee, I salute thee, and I thank thee for
all the hope thou hast given me; and I thank thee in the name of all the
sorrows that thou hast sent to sleep. [To the men] Take her hence&mdash;let
them destroy her with respect.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>They take Isis away.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>:&mdash;<i>The yard in front of the potter's hut. On the right from the
middle of the back of the scene to the footlights, the walls of the
dwelling made of beaten clay. Two unequal doors. The wall is slightly
raised supporting a terrace where pottery of all kinds is drying in the
sun. Left, a wall of loose stones high enough to lean on. Between the
wall and the house an opening leading to an invisible inclined plane
that descends to the Nile, the water and opposite bank of which are
visible. Behind the house and on the right groups of lofty palms. The
whole is abject misery beneath the splendor of a heaven blazing with
light.</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Kirjipa, crouching down, is grinding corn between a large and a small

<p><span class="smcap">Kirjipa.</span> Son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kirjipa.</span> And so you do not believe that when the moon grows little by
little less, 'tis because it is eaten by a pig?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> No, mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kirjipa.</span> Then what beast eats it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> None.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kirjipa</span> [<i>laughing</i>] You have ideas that are not reasonable. What makes
me marvel, is that your father seems to understand them. I must haste to
make the bread, that he find it when he returns.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Here comes the messenger from Rheou.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kirjipa</span> [<i>horrified</i>] The messenger of him who kills the gods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> We do not kill what has no life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kirjipa.</span> I would not see him. [<i>She picks up her corn</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kirjipa.</span> Brrr!&mdash;[<i>To herself</i>] To-morrow I shall burn some sacred herbs
here. [<i>She goes out</i>].</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Steward enters.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> Satni, I have been seeking you. Since this morning unhappy
things have come to pass&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Yaouma is not in danger, or Mieris, of Rheou?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> No. All three are safe in the palace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> You remember the order the master gave me this morning, after
the death of the gods?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> Yes, to open his granaries to all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Yes, yes, well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> When I went to obey, to my amazement I beheld the men stand by
the door in earnest converse, then without entering they withdrew. This
is what happened. They went to the house of the neighboring master,
roused his servants and laborers, and strove to force them to overthrow
the statues of his gods, and rob him of his corn. They killed his
steward. Soldiers came&mdash;Nepk had been killed, others too. Then all were
scattered. The master sent me to bid you reason with those whom you
might find. Look! there are some who have taken refuge here! [<i>To some
men who are outside</i>] Enter&mdash;come&mdash;Satni would speak with you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bitiou.</span> There.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Why do you fear them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nourm</span> [<i>to Satni</i>] They did that at his house, that you made us do at
yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> The priests heard of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nourm.</span> No, but the master sent for the soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Only for that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nourm.</span> I know not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Had there been nothing else, he would not have sent for the
Lybian soldiers. He knew our projects&mdash;he is with us. There is something

<p><span class="smcap">Nourm.</span> They were angered with the master. He was bad, the master.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> He is hard, but he gives much to those who have nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sokiti.</span> He gave here, that he might receive hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nourm.</span> After his death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> And now he gives no more?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nourm.</span> Nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Ah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bitiou.</span> Nothing&mdash;and so, all stomachs empty, very much. [<i>He laughs</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nourm.</span> He gives only blows of the stick now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sokiti</span> [<i>with conviction</i>] One cannot live on that alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nourm.</span> And so his servants asked him for corn?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bitiou.</span> No good&mdash;only blows of the stick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> They <i>took</i> the corn that was refused them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bitiou</span> [<i>laughing</i>] Hunger! [<i>A gesture</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> You knew they were going to do that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nourm.</span> It came into our heads like this: better not take corn from the
good master, but take it from the bad one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sokiti.</span> Justice!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bitiou</span> [<i>to the Steward</i>] You content. You still got all your corn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> What would he say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sokiti</span> [<i>laughing</i>] They took the steward and then&mdash;[<i>Chokes with

<p><span class="smcap">Nourm.</span> They gave him back all the blows of the stick they had had from

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> You saw that?</p>

glad. [<i>During what follows he plays with his foot</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steward.</span> What they have done is bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nourm.</span> No. The steward had been happy all his life. He was old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sokiti.</span> He was old. So 'tis not bad to have killed him&mdash;He had

<p><span class="smcap">Nourm.</span> Only just, he should leave his place to another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> We must not kill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sokiti.</span> What does that mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nourm.</span> Yes, kill a good one, that is bad. But kill a bad one, that is

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> Mistress, you seek to die? Many then must be your sorrows!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> Alas! Alas! Why did you discover my flight? Why did you seek me,
find me, and bring me back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> Had I not guessed your purpose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> What have I left to live for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> You have lived all these years in spite of your affliction, what
is there that is changed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> What is there that is changed! You ask me what is changed! Until
now I lived in the hope of a miracle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> Perhaps it would never have come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> Even at my last hour I should have still looked for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> Then you would have died believing in a lie&mdash;if what they say be
true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> What matter, I had smiled as I died, thinking death but the
journey to a land where my lost child was waiting for me. The death of a
child! No mother ever can believe, at heart, in that. It is too
unjust&mdash;too cruel to be possible. One says to oneself: it is but a
separation! Oh! Satni, thy doctrines may be the truth. But they declare
this separation eternal; they make the death of our loved ones final,
irreparable, horrible, therefore I foretell thee this: Women will never
believe them! What is there that is changed?&mdash;Yesterday, children came
playing close to us. You know how their cries and laughter made me
glad&mdash;the voice of one of them was like the voice of mine. I made him
come, I put out my hand, in the old way. I felt, at the old height,
tossed hair, and the warmth of a living body. And I did not weep, but my
voice spoke in my heart and said: "Little child, thy years are as many
as his, whom she-who-loves-the-silence took from me. But in Amenti,
where he is, in the island of souls, he is happier than thou, for he is
safe from all the ills that threaten thee. He is happier than thou. He
lives beneath a sun of gold, amid flowers of strange beauty, and
perfumed baths refresh him. And when she-who-loves-the-silence takes me
in my turn, <i>I shall see him, I shall see him</i> for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> the first time&mdash;and
I shall fondle him as I fondle thee, and none, then, may put us asunder.
Go, little child, the happy ones are not on this side of the earth!" Now
have I lost the hope of a better life before death, and the hope of a
better life beyond as well. If you took both crutches from a cripple, he
would fall. Only this twofold hope sustained me. They have taken it from
me. And so, it is the end, it is the end&mdash;'tis as though I were fallen
from a height, I am broken, I have no strength left to bear with life: I
tell you, it is the end, it is the end!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma</span> [<i>with intense fervor</i>] Mistress, they speak not the truth!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> Our gods, did they exist, would already have taken vengeance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> Before the outrage, already, they had taken vengeance on you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> Good Yaouma, you would give me back my faith, you who could not
keep your own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> Mistress, I lied to you; nothing is destroyed in me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> You refuse to give yourself in sacrifice!&mdash;Oh, you are right....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> I do not refuse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> You do not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> No. Know you how I learned, a while ago, that you were gone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> I, too, was seeking to escape.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> You?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> To go to the temple, to place myself in hands of the priests, to
give to Ammon the victim he has chosen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> Do you believe in all these fables still?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma</span> [<i>in a low voice</i>] Mistress, I have <i>seen</i> Isis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> Has one of her images been spared then?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> It was not an image that I saw. It was Isis herself, the
goddess&mdash;I have <i>seen</i> her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> You&mdash;you have seen&mdash;what is it? I know not what you say&mdash;to
see&mdash;that word has no clear sense for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> She has spoken to me&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> You have heard her voice&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> I have heard her voice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> How! How!&mdash;You were sleeping&mdash;'twas in a dream&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> I did not sleep. I did not dream. I saw her. I heard her. I was
alone, and I wept. A great sound filled me with terror. A great light
blinded me. Perfumes unknown ravished my senses. And I beheld the
goddess, more beauteous than a queen. Then all was gone&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> But her voice&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> The next day she came again, she spoke to me, she called me by
name and said to me: "Egypt will be saved by thee."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> Why did you not speak of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> I feared they would not believe me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> Oh, Yaouma, how I envy you! If you but knew the ill they have
done me. They have half killed me, killing all the legends and all the
memories that were mine. They made me blush at my simplicity. I felt
shamed to have been so easily fooled by such gross make-believes. And
now, what have I gained by this revelation? My soul is a house after the
burning, black, ruined, empty. Nothing is left but ruins, ruins one
might laugh at. [<i>In tears</i>] I am parched with thirst, I hunger, I
tremble with cold. They have made my soul blind, too. I cry out for
help, for consolation. Oh! for a lie, some other lie, to replace the one
they have taken away from me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> Why ask a lie? Why not forget what they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> have said. Why not
recall what you learned at your mother's knee&mdash;Why not, yourself, set up
in your heart again, those images which they threw down&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> Yes! Yes! I will do it. They have awakened my reason, and killed
my faith. I shall kill my reason, to revive our gods. Though I no longer
believe, I shall do the actions of believers&mdash;and, if my god be false, I
shall believe so firmly in him that I shall make him true!&mdash;Yes, the
lowest, the most senseless superstitions, I venerate them, I exalt&mdash;I
glory in them! The ugliest, the most deformed, the most unreal of our
gods, I adore them, and I bow down before their impossibility. [<i>She
kneels</i>] Oh, I stifle in their petty narrow world, sad as a forest
without birds! Air! Air! Singing! The sound of wings! Things that fly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma</span> [<i>kneeling</i>] Let me be sacrificed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> Let me have a reason for living!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> I would give my life to the gods who gave me birth!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> I would believe that there is some one above men!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> Some one who watches over us!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> Who will console as with his justice!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> Some one to cry our sorrows to!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> Yes, some one to pray to, and to thank!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma</span> [<i>sobbing</i>] Oh! the pity of it, to feel we were abandoned!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris</span> [<i>throwing herself in Yaouma's arms</i>] I would not be abandoned!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> We are not! Gods! Gods!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieris.</span> Gods! We need gods! There are too many sorrows, it is not
possible this earth should groan as it groans beneath a pitiless
heaven&mdash;Ammon, reveal thyself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma.</span> Isis, show thyself! Have pity! [<i>A pause. Then in a hushed

<h2>ACT IV</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>:&mdash;<i>The interior of a temple.</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Columns, huge as towers and covered with hieroglyphics. On the left the
Sanctuary; in the foreground in a little nook, invisible to the
faithful, but visible to the audience is installed the machinery for the
miracle, a lever, and ropes. Against the central pillar two thrones, one
magnificent, that of the Pharaoh; the other simple, that of the High
Priest.</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>The Pharaoh, the High Priest, an officer, an old man, and six priests
discovered. When the curtain rises all are seated, the priests on little
chairs between the two thrones.</i></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The Officer</span> [<i>prostrated before the Pharaoh</i>] Pharaoh! may Ammon-Ra
preserve thy life in health and strength!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> [<i>with fury</i>] My orders! My orders!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Officer.</span> Lord of the two Egypts, friend of Ra, favorite of Mentu,
may Ammon&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> Enough! my orders!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Officer.</span> I would have died&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> The wish shall be granted, be assured, and soon! My orders!
Dog, why did you not carry out my orders?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Officer.</span> Satni&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> Satni! Yes, Satni, the impostor! Where is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Officer.</span> Pharaoh&mdash;may Ammon, Soukou Ra, Horus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> I will have you whipped till your blood run&mdash;Satni! Where
is Satni! I sent you to seize him! Where is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Officer.</span> No one knows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> Scoundrel! You are his accomplice!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Officer.</span> O Ammon!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> Did you go to the house of his father, to Rheou?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Officer.</span> We searched them in vain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> He has taken flight, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Officer.</span> I know not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> You are a traitor! You shall die! Take him out! And you
others, hear the commands of the High Priest and begone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Let each fulfil the mission he is charged with. Let the
young priests mix with the crowd, the moment it enters the Temple. Let
them excite the people's fervor, that as many prodigies as possible may
be won from the goddess. Now when you are gone the stones that screen
the sanctuary will roll away before the Pharaoh and the High Priest;
and, first by right, they shall behold the goddess face to face. Humbly
prostrated we shall speak to her the mysterious words that other men
have never heard. Bow down before the Pharaoh, may he live in health and
strength [<i>All kneel and remain with their faces on the ground during
what follows, save an old man whom the High Priest calls to his side by
a sign; and to whom he says in low tones</i>] Let the man Satni be taken
from the crypt where he is imprisoned [<i>The old man bows</i>] When I give
the signal let them bring him here. While the Pharaoh goes in procession
through the town let them do what I have told you [<i>The old man bows</i>]
[<i>To the others</i>] Rise! [<i>To the Pharaoh</i>] Son of Ammon-Ra, bow down
before him who represents the god.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> [<i>The Pharaoh rises and after a
slight hesitation bows down before the High Priest</i>] Withdraw, we would
pray. [<i>Motionless the High Priest and the Pharaoh wait till the last of
the assistants are gone</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh</span> [<i>giving up his hieratic pose, angrily</i>] I would all the
flies of Egypt might eat thy tongue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest</span> [<i>without feeling</i>] The flies of Egypt are too many and my
tongue is too small, for your wish to be realized, Pharaoh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> This is the result of my weakness!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest</span> [<i>with flattering unction</i>] The Pharaoh, Son of
Ammon-Ra&mdash;Lord of the two Egypts&mdash;Friend of Ra&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> Enough! Enough! We are alone. There are none whom your
words may deceive. And your mock-reverence fools not me. You would not
let me put Satni to death, your subtleties confused my mind, I gave in
to you, and now Satni escapes us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> You should not let anger master you for that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> Satni has foretold to thousands of ears that there will be
no miracle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> The miracle will be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> Who knows that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> Satni has declared he will enter the temple&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> 'Tis possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> He has declared he knows the secret recess, whence one of
your priests makes the head of the image move.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Most like he speaks the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> He declares the miracle will not take place. If the people
suffer this disappointment, tell me what chance can there be for the war
of conquest I would wage in Ethiopia?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Why wage a war of conquest in Ethiopia?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> I need gold. I need women. I need slaves. There will be a
share of the spoil for your temple.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> I like not bloodshed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> The treasury is empty. Our whippings are useless now. Our
blows no longer bring forth taxes. If the people lose confidence in the
gods, what will happen to-morrow? Who will follow me, unless they
believe the gods confirm my orders?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Satni will not prevent the miracle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> What do you know of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> Is Satni dead?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> He lives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh</span> [<i>suddenly guessing</i>] You are hiding him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> You knew I was about to rid me of him, and you took him to
prevent me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> What do you intend?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> It shall be done with him as I wish, not as you wish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> His crime is a crime against Egypt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> A crime against me. That is still more grave. Therefore be
satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> Why then all these ceremonies before you kill him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> That all may know his faults.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> Satni was one of yours, and you defend him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> We must not make martyrs&mdash;if we can avoid it. In killing
Satni you would have killed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> only a man. If what I dream succeed, I
shall kill his work. That is a better thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> What will you make of him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> A priest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> A priest?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> He was initiated before he went away. He was then a young
man, pious and wise. On his travels he lost some piety, and gained some
wisdom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> Have I not always said: "it is not good to travel."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> I think like you. Travellers learn too much. Yet am I
hopeful. I shall bring him back to our gods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> You will fail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> He who for long has breathed the air of temples can never
wholly clear his breast of it. If he give way, he shall never leave the
house of the Gods again, if he be still rebellious, he shall leave to go
to his death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> I order you to give Satni up to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> I would I might bow to your will. But he is a priest: his
life is sacred. And I may not transgress the orders given me by the
Gods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> Prate not of these follies to me&mdash;do you take me for one of
your priests? Obey! I command you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Do you take me for one of your soldiers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> I command it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> The gods forbid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> I laugh at your gods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Beware lest your people hear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> I would be master, in truth. And more, I refuse to submit
to the humiliation that again you put on me a while ago.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> How should that humiliate you? Before you, the highest bow
down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> Yes. And straightway, then, I must bow me down before you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> You salute, not me, but the god whom I represent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> I pay homage to the god, it is the priest who receives it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest</span> [<i>faintly smiling</i>] Rest assured! I pass it on to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> And you mock me, besides! Oh! if I but dared to kill you,
hypocrite!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Vain man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> You tremble at sight of a sword, coward!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Being a butcher, you know only how to kill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> Liar!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Who made you Pharaoh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pharaoh.</span> Beware lest one day I have you thrown to my lions!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Beware lest one day I strike the crown of the two Egypts
from your head, telling the people the god has set his face against you!
[<i>A pause</i>] Come, we must work together. We complete each other. To
govern men, we have both the reality of the evils you inflict on them,
and the hope of the good I promise them. Believe me, we must work
together. The day that one of us disappears, the fate of the other will
be in jeopardy&mdash;I perceive they make sign to me. They think our prayers
are long and fervent. The hour is come for you to receive the
acclamation of your people, and follow them to the shrine of Isis&mdash;when
Satni will not prevent the miracle, I pledge my word to that.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The cort&eacute;ge comes on and goes out with Pharaoh. Satni is
led before the High Priest.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> You know me again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni</span> [<i>troubled</i>] Yes, you are the High Priest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest</span> [<i>with sweet gentleness</i>] I, too, I know you again. Your
father is a potter. You were brought up and taught by us. In the crowd
of neophytes I singled you out by your gentleness, your great
intelligence; and I saw you destined for the highest dignities. I
esteemed you, I was fond of you. We took you from wretchedness. What you
know, for the most part, you owe to us. This thing that you have done
should anger me&mdash;I am only sad, my son. [<i>A pause</i>] You are troubled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Yes, I looked for threats, for torture. The kindness of your
voice unmans me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Be not distressed. Forget who I am. None hear us. Let us
talk together as father and son. Or better, since your learning makes
you worthy, as two men. You have proclaimed broadcast that the miracle
will not come to pass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> The goddess is stone. Stone does not move itself. The image will
not bow its head unless man intervene.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> That is evident.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> You admit it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> To you, yes. We give to each one the faith he deserves. Had
you remained with us, at each step in the priesthood you would have
beheld the gods rise with you, become more immaterial, more noble, as
you became more learned. We give to the people the gods they can
understand. Our god is different. He is the one who exists in essence.
The one who lives in substance, the sole procreator who was not
engendered, the father of the fathers, the mother of mothers. The one
and only. And we crave his pardon for belittling him by miracles. But
they are part of that faith which alone contents the simple-minded. You
are above them&mdash;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> admit freely that the miracle could be prevented. You
declared it would not take place&mdash;you have found the means to make it
impossible?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni</span> [<i>suspecting the trap</i>] I said that, left to herself, the goddess
would not move.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> To say only that, would not have served you. You intended
to prevent the miracle. Come, admit it&mdash;it is so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> By seizing you, I prevent your committing the sacrilege.
Your purpose will not be realized. In an hour the festival of the
Prodigy will take place, and you are my prisoner. It follows then, the
miracle will be performed&mdash;you believe that, do you not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni</span> [<i>after a pause</i>] Yes, I believe it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> And so your cause is lost. [<i>A pause</i>] Listen to me; the
priests who have taken their final vows are as wise and as little
credulous as you. I offer you a place among them. Return to us. A little
wisdom banishes the gods&mdash;great wisdom brings them back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> I refuse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> My son, my son, you will not cause me this sorrow. Think
what you will drive me to, if you refuse&mdash;Satni, do not force me to send
you before the tribunal, whose sentence must be death. Death, for you,
so young, whose future is so bright!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> I do not fear death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Besides&mdash;I mind me&mdash;you were betrothed to that little
Yaouma whom the god has chosen as victim. You know she may be saved from
the sacrifice, if she become the wife of a priest. They guarded her but
ill at Rheou's house, she is here. I have seen her; she is kind and
gentle, and you would lead a happy life with her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Yaouma! Yaouma! [<i>He hides his face</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest</span> [<i>laying a hand on his shoulder</i>] So that on one side is
Yaouma's death and yours; on the other, happiness with her&mdash;and power.
Say nothing. I speak as a father might, you can see. I say besides, that
you will better serve the crowd in leaving them their gods. I wish to
convince you of it, and you will stay with us&mdash;weep no more. You will
stay, will you not? Wait! Hear me, before you answer. You seek happiness
for the lower orders? There is no happiness for them without religion.
Already you have seen what they become, when it is taken from them. The
riots of yesterday cost your father his life. He suffered much, they
tell me. Is it true? I do not know the details. You saw him die, did you
not? Tell me how it happened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Ah! I was right. It was in truth torture that awaited me here.
You have guessed you would gain nothing racking my body&mdash;you keep your
torments for my heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Have I said other than what is true? The conversions that
your preaching made were followed by disorders&mdash;was it not then that
your father was wounded? I knew him. He was a man, simple and good. You
are the cause of his death, as you will be the cause of Yaouma's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Peace! You would have my sorrows crush my will!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> I shall speak of them no more. But think of the people of
Egypt, what evils you would bring on them! If you take away their
religion, what will keep them virtuous?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> What you call their virtue, is only their submission.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> You let loose their vilest instincts, if you remove the
fear of the gods.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> The fear of the gods has prevented fewer crimes than were needed
to create it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Be it so. But it exists.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> It is your interest to spread the belief, that the fear of the
gods is a restraint. And you know that it is not. You do not leave the
punishment of crime to the gods. You have the lash, hard labor in the
mines; you have scaffolds, you have executioners. No one believes
sincerely in the happy life beyond the grave. If we believed, we should
kill ourselves, the sooner to reach the Island of the Souls, the fields
of Yalou.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> By what then are the appetites restrained?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> By the laws, by the need of the esteem of others&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> We have just seen that, in sooth. So then it was virtue
that the people showed yesterday, after you made them break their gods?
They seemed to care little for the esteem of others, for they stole,
they pillaged, they killed. Do you approve of that? Have they gained
your esteem, those who have done what they have done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Oh, I know! I know! That is your strongest argument. Creatures
degraded by centuries of slavery, drunk with the first hours of freedom,
commit crimes. You argue from this, that they were meant for slaves.
Yes, it is true that if you take a child from the leading strings that
upheld it, the child falls down. But you who watch over it, you rejoice
at the fall, for then you can assert that the child must go back to its
leading strings&mdash;and be kept in them till death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Then you declare that all supports must be suppressed? [<i>A
pause</i>] Religion is a prop. It soothes&mdash;consoles. He does evil who
disturbs it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Many religions died before ours. The passing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> of each caused the
sorrows you foresee. Should we then have kept the first, to prevent some
suffering?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Ours is yet young, though so old; look in the halls of our
temples, behold the countless thank-offerings brought there for prayers
that were granted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Your temples could not hold the offerings, unthinkable in number,
that those whose prayers were not granted might have made, and who none
the less prayed as well as the others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Even unanswered their prayers were recompensed. They had
hope, and it is likewise a boon to the poor to promise them welfare in
the world to come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> You promise them welfare in the world to come, to make them
forget that all the welfare in this world is yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Can you give happiness to all who are on earth? We are more
generous than you; at least we give them consolation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> You make them pay dear for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> In truth the granaries of our temples are full to
overflowing. Left to themselves, the people would not think of the lean
years, in the years of abundance. We think for them, and they bring us,
gladly, what they would refuse did they not believe they gave to the
gods. We proclaim the Nile sacred; it is forbidden to sully its waters.
Is that to honor it as a god? Not so, it is to avoid the plague. And all
the animals we deified are those man has need of. You did not learn all
things on your travels&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> You would have the peasant remain a child, because you fear the
reckoning he would demand of you, if you let him grow up. You know you
could not stay him then by showing him the god-jackal, the god-ram, the
god-bull, and the rest that do not exist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Are you certain they do not exist?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Yes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Know you where you are?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> In the temple.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> In the temple; where you were brought up. There was a time
when you dared not have crossed the first sacred enclosure. You are in
the third. Look round! There is the holy of holies. At my will the
stones that mask the entrance will roll back, and the goddess will be
unveiled. Except the High Priest and the Pharaoh, no mortal, if he be
not priest himself, may look on her and live&mdash;save at the hour of the
annual Festival of Prodigies, which is upon us now. Do you believe that
you can endure to be alone in her presence?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> I do believe it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> We shall see. If you be afraid, call and prostrate
yourself. Afterwards you shall go and tell what you have seen, to those
whom you deceived.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The High Priest makes a sign. Total darkness. A peal of

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Ah! [<i>Terrified, he leaps forward. A faint light returns slowly,
the temple is empty</i>] I am alone! [<i>He is terrified, standing erect
against a pillar facing the audience</i>] Alone in the temple, within sight
of the goddess almost. I know 'tis but an image&mdash;yet am I steeped in
terror, even to the marrow of my bones. [<i>He utters an agonized cry</i>]
Ah!&mdash;I thought I beheld in the darkness&mdash;No&mdash;I know that there is
nothing&mdash;Oh! coward nature! Because I was cradled amid tales of
religion, because I grew up in the fear of the gods, because my father
and my father's father, and all those from whom I come, were crushed by
this terror even from the blackest night of time, I tremble, and my
reason totters. All this is false, I know&mdash;the god obeys the priest.
Yet, from these towering columns, horror and mystery descend upon
me&mdash;[<i>A thunder clap brings him to his knees. The stones that mask the
entrance to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> the sanctuary roll slowly back. He tries to look</i>] The holy
of holies opens&mdash;I am afraid&mdash;I am afraid&mdash;[<i>He mutters words, wipes the
sweat from his brow with his hand. He trembles and falls sobbing to the
ground. A long pause</i>] 'Tis the beast in me that is afraid&mdash;Ah! coward
flesh! [<i>Biting his hands</i>] I shall conquer thee&mdash;I would chastise my
weakness. I am shamed&mdash;I am shamed&mdash;In spite of all I will look her in
the face. I have the will! but I must fight against so many memories,
against all the dead whose spirits stir in mine. I shall conquer the
dead. My life, and my will&mdash;courage!</p>

<h2>ACT V</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>:&mdash;<i>Same as Acts I and II.</i></p>

<p><i>The statues of the gods are set up again, in their places,
facing them a throne has been erected on which the High
Priest is seated. Rheou, Satni, Mieris, Yaouma, Sokiti,
Nourm, Bitiou, the Steward and all the women and servants of
the household, and the laborers. When the curtain rises all
are prostrate with their faces to the ground.</i></p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">High Priest</span> [<i>after a pause</i>] Rise! [<i>All rise to their knees. A pause</i>]
The divine images are again in their places. You have shown that you
repent. You have begged for pardon. You have testified your horror of
the terrible crime you were driven to commit. You await your
chastisement. The gods now permit that we proceed to the sacrifice, that
will bring about the overflowing of the Nile, and give for yet another
year, life to the land of Egypt. She who has chosen, the elect, the
savior, is she here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yaouma</span> [<i>rising to her feet, radiant</i>] I am here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Let her go to clothe her in the sacred robe. Form the

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>A number of the women rise and go out right with Yaouma.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> To-day, at the hour when Ammon-Ra came forth from the
underworld, I entered the sanctuary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> Face to face with the god, I heard
his words, which now you shall hear from me. These are the commands of
the God. Rheou! [<i>Rheou stands up</i>] You have been to make submission to
the Pharaoh&mdash;Light of Ra&mdash;you have implored his mercy. You have sworn on
the body of your father, to serve him faithfully, and you have given
that body to him in pledge of your obedience. You have denounced to his
anger and justice those who conceived the impious plot to dethrone the
Lord of Egypt. You have declared that if you did permit the images of
the gods to be thrown down before you, it was because the spells of
Satni had clouded your reason. Ammon has proclaimed to me that you are
sincere! You are pardoned, on conditions which I shall presently impart.
[<i>Rheou bows and kneels down</i>] Satni! [<i>Satni stands up. He casts down
his eyes, he is steeped in sorrow and shame</i>] Satni, you have admitted
and proclaimed the power of the gods, whom you dared to deny. You have
bowed you down before them. Once, in the temple, you took the first
priestly vows; your life is therefore sacred. But you stand now
reproved. This very day you will quit Egypt. Withdraw from the Gods!
[<i>Satni, with eyes on the ground, withdraws, the people shrink aside to
let him pass, abusing him in whispers, shaking their fists, and some
even striking him. He goes to the terrace down left where he stands,
hiding his face on his arm</i>] Ammon has spoken other words. [<i>The people
turn from Satni</i>] All you who are here, you are guilty of the most
odious, the most monstrous of crimes. You are all deserving of death.
Such is the decree of the God.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span> O Ammon! Pity! Pity! Ammon!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Cease your sobs! Cease your cries! Cease your useless
prayers! Hear the God who speaks through my mouth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span> Be kind! Thou! Thou! Have pity! Beseech<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> the God for us, we implore
thee! We would not die. Not death! not death! not death!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Yes&mdash;I&mdash;I have pity on you. But your crime is so great!
Have you considered well the enormity of your sin? None can remember to
have seen the like. The Gods! To overthrow the Gods! And such Gods!
Ammon and Thoueris! I would I might disarm their wrath. But what shall I
offer them in your name that may equal your offence?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">People.</span> All! Take all we possess, but spare our lives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> All you possess! 'Tis little enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">People.</span> Take our crops.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> And who then will feed you? Already you pay tithes. I will
offer a fourth of your harvests for ten years. But 'tis little. Even did
I say you would give half of all that is in your homes, should I
succeed? And would you give it me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">People.</span> Yes! Yes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Still it will not be enough. Hear what the God hath
breathed to me. There must be prayers, ceaseless prayers in the temple.
Every year ten of your daughters must enter the house of the God to be
consecrated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">People.</span> Our daughters! Ammon! Our daughters!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> The God is good! The God is good! Lo! I hear him pronounce
the words of pardon. But further, you must needs assist the Pharaoh to
carry out the divine commands. Ammon wills that the Ethiopian infidels
be chastised. All who are of an age to fight will join the army, that is
on the eve of departure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">People</span> [<i>in consternation</i>] Oh! the war! the war!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> Proud Ethiopia threatens invasion to Egypt. You must defend
your tombs, your homes, and your women. Would you become slaves of the
blacks?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">People.</span> We will go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High Priest.</span> And what will be your reward? Know you not that victory
will be yours, because the god is with you. And if some fall in battle,
should we not all envy their fate, since they leave this world to go
towards Osiris. The arrows of your foes will fall harmless at your feet,
like wounded birds. Their swords shall bend on your invulnerable bodies.
The fire they light against you will become as perfumed water. All this
you know to be true. You know that your gods protect you. You know they
are all-powerful, because, yesterday, you all did see how the stone
image of the goddess Isis did bow, to show you she protects you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">People.</span> To the war! To the war! To Ethiopia!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni</span> [<i>leaping up to the terrace</i>] I have been coward too long! [<i>To

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Curse me. You are right. I am guilty. I had not the strength to
persevere; to lead you, in spite of your tears, to the summits I would
lead you to. To still a few sobs, to give hope to some who were
stricken, I worked the miracle; and, beholding that false miracle, you
made submission. I have confirmed, I have strengthened the empire of the
lie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Man.</span> 'Twas you who lied.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> I have given back your minds, for another age, to slavery and
debasement. I have given back to the priests their power that was
endangered. I have given them means to increase your burdens, to take
your daughters, to send you to a war, covetous, murderous, and unjust.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Man.</span> You are a spy from Ethiopia!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Another.</span> You are a traitor to your country!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span> Yes! a traitor! Death to the traitor!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> And to defend your tyrants, you will kill men as wretched as
yourselves, dupes like you, and like you enslaved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Man.</span> We know you are paid to betray Egypt!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span> Yes, we know it! We know the price of your treason!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Another.</span> You would sell Egypt, and 'tis to weaken us you would overthrow
our gods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span> Traitor! Traitor!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> If I am a traitor, 'tis to my own cause! But a while ago I was
proud of my deed, thinking I had sacrificed myself to you. Alas! I only
sacrificed your future to my pity. I wept for you; to weep for
misfortune&mdash;what is that but an easy escape from the duty of fighting
its cause? I pitied you. Pity is but a weakness, a submission&mdash;To

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>They laugh.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> They have implanted in you, the belief that misery is immortal,
invincible. By my falsehood, I too have seemed to admit this; and thus I
have helped those, in whose interest it is that misery should last for
ever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Satni.</span> Had there been no miracle, you would have despaired&mdash;you would
have sorrowed. I ought to have faced that. I ought to have faced the
death of a few, to save the future of all. We go forward only by
destroying. What matter blood and pain! Pain and blood&mdash;never a child is

<h2>ACT I</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene I</span>:&mdash;<i>A small reception-room in an old house at Mauleon.</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The curtain rises, revealing Madame Vagret in evening
dress; she is altering the position of the chairs to her own
satisfaction. Enter Bertha, also in evening dress, a
newspaper in her hand.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha.</span> Here's the local paper, the <i>Journal</i>. I sent the <i>Official
Gazette</i> to father; he has just come home from the Court. He's dressing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Is the sitting over?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha.</span> No, not yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret</span> [<i>taking the newspaper</i>] Are they still discussing the
case?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha.</span> As usual.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> One doesn't need to search long. There's a big head-line
at the top of the page: "The Irissary Murder." They're attacking your
father now! [<i>She reads</i>] "Monsieur Vagret, our District Attorney."
[<i>She continues to read to herself</i>] And there are sub-headings too:
"The murderer still at large." As if that was our fault! "Justice
asleep!" Justice asleep indeed! How can they say such things when your
father hasn't closed his eyes for a fortnight! Can they complain that he
hasn't done his duty? Or that Monsieur Delorme, the examining
magistrate, isn't doing his? He has made himself quite ill, poor man!
Only the day before yesterday he had a tramp arrested because his
movements were ever so little suspicious! So you see! No! I tell you
these journalists are crazy!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha.</span> It seems they are going to have an article in the Basque paper
too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> The <i>Eskual Herria</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha.</span> So the chemist told me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> I don't care a sou for that. The Attorney-General doesn't
read it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha.</span> On the contrary, father was saying the other day that the
Attorney-General has translations sent him of every article dealing with
the magistracy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> The Attorney-General has translations sent him! Oh well,
never mind. Anyhow, let's change the subject! How many shall we be this
evening? You've got the list?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha</span> [<i>She takes the list from the over-mantel</i>] The President of
Assizes&mdash;the President of the Court&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Yes. Yes, that's all right; nine in all, isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha.</span> Nine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Nine! To have nine people coming to dinner, and not to
know the exact hour at which they'll arrive! That's what's so trying
about these dinners we have to give at the end of a session&mdash;in honor of
the President of Assizes. One dines when the Court rises. When the Court
rises! Well, we'll await the good pleasure of these gentlemen! [<i>She
sighs</i>] Well, child!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha.</span> Mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Are you still anxious to marry a magistrate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha</span> [<i>with conviction</i>] I am not!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> But you were two years ago!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha.</span> I am not now!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Look at us! There's your father. Procurator of the
Republic&mdash;Public Prosecutor&mdash;State Attorney; in a court of the third
class,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> it's true, because he's not a wire-puller, because he hasn't
played the political game. And yet he's a valuable man&mdash;no one can deny
that. Since he's been District Attorney he has secured three sentences
of penal servitude for life! And in a country like this, where crimes
are so frightfully rare! That's pretty good, don't you think? Of course,
I know he'll have had three acquittals in the session that ends to-day.
Granted. But that was mere bad luck. And for protecting society as he
does&mdash;what do they pay him? Have you any idea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha.</span> Yes, I know; you've often told me, mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> And I'll tell you again. Counting the stoppages for the
pension, he gets altogether, and for everything, three hundred and
ninety-five francs and eighty-three centimes a month. And then we are
obliged to give a dinner for nine persons in honor of the President of
Assizes, a Councillor! Well, at all events, I suppose everything is
ready? Let's see. My <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>&mdash;is it there? Yes. And my
armchair&mdash;is that in the right place? [<i>She sits in it</i>] Yes. [<i>As
though receiving a guest</i>] Pray be seated, Monsieur le Pr&eacute;sident. I hope
that's right. And Monsieur Dufour, who was an ordinary magistrate when
your father was the same, when we were living at Castelnaudery, he's now
President of the second class at Douai, and he was only at Brest before
he was promoted!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha.</span> Really!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret</span> [<i>searching for a book on the over-mantel</i>] Look in the
Year Book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha.</span> I'll take your word for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> You may! The Judicial Year Book. I know it by heart!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha.</span> But then father may be appointed Councillor any day now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> He's been waiting a long time for his appointment as
Councillor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha.</span> But it's as good as settled now. He was promised the first
vacancy, and Monsieur Lef&eacute;vre has just died.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> I hope to God you are right. If we fail this time, we're
done for. We shall be left at Mauleon until he's pensioned off. What a
misfortune it is that they can't put their hands on that wretched
murderer! Such a beautiful crime too! We really had some reason for
hoping for a death sentence this time! The first, remember!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha.</span> Don't worry, motherkins. There's still a chance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> It's easy for you to talk. You see the newspapers are
beginning to grumble. They reproach us, they say we are slack. My dear
child, you don't realize&mdash;there 's a question of sending a detective
down from Paris! It would be such a disgrace! And everything promised so
well! You can't imagine how excited your father was when they waked him
up to tell him that an old man of eighty-seven had been murdered in his
district! He dressed himself in less than five minutes. He was very
quiet about it. But he gripped my hands. "I think," he said, "I think we
can count on my nomination this time!" [<i>She sighs</i>] And now everything
is spoilt, and all through this ruffian who won't let them arrest him!
[<i>Another sigh</i>] What's the time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha.</span> It has just struck six.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Write out the <i>menus</i>. Don't forget. You must write only
their titles&mdash;his Honor the President of Assizes, his Honor the
President of the High Court of Mauleon, and so forth. It's the preamble
to the <i>menu</i>. Don't forget. Here is your father. Go and take a look
round the kitchen and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> appear as if you were busy. [<i>Bertha leaves the
room. Vagret enters in evening dress</i>]</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene II</span>:&mdash;<i>Vagret, Madame Vagret.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Hasn't the Court risen yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> When I left my substitute was just getting up to ask for the
adjournment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Nothing new?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> About the murder? Nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> But your Monsieur Delorme&mdash;the examining magistrate&mdash;is
he really looking for the murderer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> He's doing what he can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Well, if I were in his place, it seems to me&mdash;Oh, they
ought to have women for examining magistrates! [<i>Distractedly</i>] Is there
nothing in the <i>Official Gazette</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret</span> [<i>dispirited and anxious</i>] Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> And you never told me. Anything that affects us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> No. Nanteuil has been appointed Advocate-General.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Nanteuil?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Oh, that's too bad! Why, he was only an assistant at
Lun&eacute;ville when you were substitute there!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Yes. But he has a cousin who's a deputy. You can't compete with
men like that. [<i>A pause. Madame Vagret sits down and begins to cry</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> We haven't a chance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> My dearest! Come, come, you are wrong there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret</span> [<i>still tearful</i>] My poor darling! I know very well it
isn't your fault; you do your best.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> Your only failing is that you are
too scrupulous, and I am not the one to reproach you for that. But what
can you expect? It's no use talking; everybody gets ahead of us. Soon
you'll be the oldest District Attorney in France.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Come, come! Where's the Year Book?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret</span> [<i>still in the same tone</i>] It's there&mdash;the dates, the
length of service. See further on, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret</span> [<i>throwing the Year Book aside</i>] Don't cry like that! Remember
I'm chosen to succeed Lef&eacute;vre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> I know that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> I'm on the list for promotion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> So is everybody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> And I have the Attorney-General's definite promise&mdash;and the
presiding judge's too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> It's the deputy's promise you ought to have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Yes, the deputy's. Up to now you've waited for promotion
to come to you. My dear, you've got to run after it! If you don't do as
the others do, you'll simply get left behind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> I am still an honest man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> It is because you are an honest man that you ought to try
to get a better appointment. If the able and independent magistrates
allow the others to pass them by, what will become of the magistracy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> There's some truth in what you say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> If, while remaining scrupulously honest, you can better
our position by getting a deputy to push you, you are to blame if you
don't do so. After all, what do they ask you to do? Merely that you
should support the Ministry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> I can do that honestly. Its opinions are my own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Then you'd better make haste&mdash;for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> a ministry doesn't
last long! To support the Ministry is to support the Government&mdash;that
is, the State&mdash;that is, Society. It's to do your duty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> You are ambitious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> No, my dear&mdash;but we must think of the future. If you knew
the trouble I have to make both ends meet! We ought to get Bertha
married. And the boys will cost us more and more as time goes on. And in
our position we are bound to incur certain useless expenses which we
could very well do without; but we have to keep up appearances; we have
to "keep up our position." We want Georges to enter the Polytechnique,
and that'll cost a lot of money. And Henri, if he's going to study
law&mdash;you'd be able to help him on all the better if you held a better
position.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret</span> [<i>after a brief silence</i>] I haven't told you everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret</span> [<i>timidly</i>] Cortan has been appointed Councillor at Amiens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret</span> [<i>exasperated</i>] Cortan! That idiot of a Cortan?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> This is too much!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> What can you expect? The new Keeper of the Seals is in his
department. You can't fight against that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> There's always something&mdash;Cortan! Won't she be making a
show of herself&mdash;Madame Cortan&mdash;who spells "indictment" i-n-d-i-t-e?
She'll be showing off her yellow hat! Don't you remember her famous
yellow hat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> It's her husband who ought to wear that color!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Rosa, that's unjust.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret</span> [<i>painfully excited</i>] I know it&mdash;but it does me good!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Enter Catial&eacute;na.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Catial&eacute;na.</span> Madame, where shall I put the parcel we took from the
linen-closet this morning?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> What parcel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catial&eacute;na.</span> The parcel&mdash;you know, Madame&mdash;when we were arranging the
things in the linen-closet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret</span> [<i>suddenly</i>] Oh&mdash;yes, yes. Take it to my room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catial&eacute;na.</span> Where shall I put it there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Oh well, put it down here. I will put it away myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catial&eacute;na.</span> Very good, Madame. [<i>She leaves the room</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret</span> [<i>snipping at the parcel and speaking to herself</i>] It's no
use stuffing it with moth-balls&mdash;it'll all be moth-eaten before ever you
wear it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret</span> [<i>placing the parcel on the table and opening the
wrapper</i>] Look!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Ah, yes&mdash;my red robe&mdash;the one you bought for me&mdash;in advance&mdash;two
years ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Yes. That time it was Gamard who was appointed instead of
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> What could you expect? Gamard had a deputy for his
brother-in-law; there's no getting over that. The Ministry has to assure
itself of a majority.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> And to think that in spite of all my searching I haven't
been able to discover so much as a municipal councillor among our
relations!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Well&mdash;hide this thing. It torments me. [<i>He returns the gown,
which he had unfolded, to his wife</i>] In any case I dare say it wouldn't
fit me now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Oh, they fit anybody, these things!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Let's see&mdash;[<i>He takes off his coat</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> And it means a thousand francs more a year!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> It isn't faded. [<i>At this moment Bertha enters. Vagret hides the
red gown</i>] What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha.</span> It's only me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> You startled me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha</span> [<i>catching sight of the gown</i>] You've been appointed! You've been
appointed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Do be quiet! Turn the key in the door!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha.</span> Papa has been appointed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Do as you're told! No, he hasn't been appointed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> It's really as good as new. [<i>He slips it on</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Well, I should hope so! I took care to get the very best
silk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Ah, if I could only wear this on my back when I'm demanding the
conviction of the Irissary murderer! Say what you like, the man who
devised this costume was no fool! It's this sort of thing that impresses
the jury. And the prisoner too! I've seen him unable to tear his eyes
from the gown of the State Attorney! And you feel a stronger man when
you wear it. It gives one a better presence, and one's gestures are more
dignified: "Gentlemen of the court, gentlemen of the jury!" Couldn't I
make an impressive indictment? "Gentlemen of the court, gentlemen of the
jury! In the name of society, of which I am the avenging voice&mdash;in the
name of the sacred interests of humanity&mdash;in the name of the eternal
principles of morality&mdash;fortified by the consciousness of my duty and my
right&mdash;I rise&mdash;[<i>He repeats his gesture</i>] I rise to demand the head of
the wretched man who stands before you!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Bertha!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha.</span> Yes, mother!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catial&eacute;na</span> [<i>holding out an envelope</i>] This has just come for you, sir.
[<i>She goes out again</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> What's this? The Basque paper&mdash;the <i>Eskual Herria</i>&mdash;an article
marked with blue pencil. [<i>He reads</i>] "Eskual herri guzia hamabartz egun
huntan&mdash;" How's one to make head or tail of such a barbarian language!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret</span> [<i>reading over his shoulder</i>] It's about you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Yes. There! "Vagret procuradoreak galdegin&mdash;" Wait a
minute. [<i>Calling through the further doorway</i>] Catial&eacute;na! Catial&eacute;na!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Catial&eacute;na will translate it for us. [<i>To Catial&eacute;na, who
has entered</i>] Here, Catial&eacute;na, just read this bit for us, will you?</p>

oraino gakpoian Irrysaryko."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> And what does that mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catial&eacute;na.</span> That means&mdash;they haven't arrested the Irissary murderer yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> We know that. And then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catial&eacute;na.</span> "Baginakien yadanik dona Mauleano tribunala yuye arin edo

except those they've got rid of from other places, and who don't know
their business&mdash;empty heads they've got.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Thanks&mdash;that's enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> No, no! Go on, Catial&eacute;na!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catial&eacute;na.</span> "Yaun hoyen Biribi&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Biribi?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catial&eacute;na.</span> Yes, Madame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Well, what does Biribi mean in Basque?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catial&eacute;na.</span> I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> What? You don't know? You mean you don't want to say? Is
it a bad word?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catial&eacute;na.</span> Oh no, Madame, I should know it then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Biribi&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha.</span> Perhaps it's a nickname they give you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Perhaps that's it. [<i>A pause</i>] Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catial&eacute;na.</span> They're speaking of the master.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret</span> [<i>to her husband</i>] I told you so. [<i>To Catial&eacute;na</i>] Abusing
him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> I tell you that's enough! [<i>He snatches the paper from Catial&eacute;na
and puts it in his pocket</i>] Go back to the kitchen. Hurry now&mdash;quicker
than that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catial&eacute;na.</span> Well, sir, I swear I won't tell you the rest of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> No one's asking you to. Be off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catial&eacute;na.</span> I knew the master would be angry. [<i>She turns to go</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Catial&eacute;na!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catial&eacute;na.</span> Yes, Madame?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Really now, you don't know what Biribi means?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catial&eacute;na.</span> No, Madame, I swear I don't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> That's all right. There's the bell&mdash;go and see who it is.
[<i>Catial&eacute;na goes</i>] I shall give that woman a week's notice, and no later
than to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> But really&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catial&eacute;na</span> [<i>returning</i>] If you please, sir, it's Monsieur Delorme.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Your examining magistrate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Yes. He's come to give me his reply. [<i>To Catial&eacute;na</i>] Show him
in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> What reply?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> He has come to return me his brief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> The brief?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Yes. I asked him to think it over until this evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> He'll have to stay to dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> No. You know perfectly well his health&mdash;Here he is. Run away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret</span> [<i>amiably, as she goes out</i>] Good-evening, Monsieur
Delorme.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delorme.</span> Madame!</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene IV</span>:&mdash;<i>Vagret, Delorme.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Well, my dear fellow, what is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delorme.</span> Well, it's no&mdash;positively no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delorme.</span> I've told you. [<i>A pause</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> And the <i>alibi</i> of your accused?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delorme.</span> I've verified it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Does it hold water?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delorme.</span> Incontestably.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret</span> [<i>dejectedly</i>] Then you've set your man at liberty?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delorme</span> [<i>regretfully</i>] I simply had to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret</span> [<i>the same</i>] Obviously. [<i>A pause</i>] There is not a chance?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delorme.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Well, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delorme.</span> Well, I beg you to give the brief to someone else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Is that final?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delorme.</span> Yes. You see, my dear fellow, I'm too old to adapt myself to
the customs of the day. I'm a magistrate of the old school, just as you
are. I inherited from my father certain scruples which are no longer the
fashion. These daily attacks in the press get on my nerves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> They would cease at the news of an arrest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delorme.</span> Precisely. I should end by doing something foolish. Well, I
have done something foolish already. I should not have arrested that man
if I had not been badgered as I was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> He was a tramp. You gave him shelter for a few days. There's no
great harm done there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delorme.</span> All the same&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> You let yourself be too easily discouraged. To-night or
to-morrow something may turn up to put you on a new scent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delorme.</span> Even then&mdash;Do you know what they are saying? They are saying
that Ma&icirc;tre Pla&ccedil;at, the Bordeaux advocate, is coming to defend the
prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> I don't see what he has to gain by that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delorme.</span> He wants to come forward at the next election in our
arrondissement&mdash;and he counts on attacking certain persons in his plea,
so as to gain a little popularity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> How can that affect you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delorme.</span> Why, he can be present at all the interrogations of the
accused. The law allows it&mdash;and as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> he is ravenous for publicity, he
would tell the newspapers just what he pleased, and if my proceedings
didn't suit him, I'd be vilified in the papers day after day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> You are exaggerating.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delorme.</span> I'm not. Nowadays an examination takes place in the
market-place or the editorial offices of the newspapers rather than in
the magistrate's office.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> That is true where notorious criminals are concerned. In reality
the new law benefits them and them only&mdash;you know as well as I do that
for the general run of accused persons&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delorme.</span> Seriously, I beg you to take the brief back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Come! You can't imagine that Ma&icirc;tre Pla&ccedil;at, who has a hundred
cases to plead, can be present at all your interrogations. You know what
usually happens. He'll send some little secretary&mdash;if he sends anyone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delorme.</span> I beg you not to insist, my dear Vagret. My decision is
irrevocable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Then&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delorme.</span> Allow me to take my leave. I don't want to meet my colleagues
who are dining with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Then I'll see you to-morrow. I'm sorry&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delorme.</span> Good-night.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>He goes out. Madame Vagret at once enters by another door.</i></p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene V</span>:&mdash;<i>Vagret, Madame Vagret, then Bertha, Bunerat, La Bouzole,
Mouzon.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Well, I heard&mdash;he gave you back the brief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Yes&mdash;his health&mdash;the newspapers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> And now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Be careful. No one suspects anything yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Make your mind easy. [<i>She listens</i>] This time it is our
guests.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha.</span> [<i>entering</i>] Here they are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> To your work, Bertha! And for me the <i>Revue des Deux
Mondes</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>They sit down. A pause.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha.</span> They are a long time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> It's Madame Bunerat. Her manners always take time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Manservant.</span> His Honor the President of the Court and Madame Bunerat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> How do you do, dear Madame Bunerat? [<i>They exchange
greetings</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Manservant.</span> His Honor Judge La Bouzole. His worship Judge Mouzon.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Salutations; the guests seat themselves.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret</span> [<i>to Madame Bunerat</i>] Well, Madame, so another session's
finished!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bunerat.</span> Yes, at last!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Your husband, I imagine, is not sorry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bunerat.</span> Nor yours, I'm sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> And the President of Assizes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> He will be a little late. He wants to get away early to-morrow
morning, and he has a mass of documents to sign. You must remember the
Court has barely risen. When we saw that we should be sitting so late we
sent for our evening clothes, and we changed while the jury was
deliberating; then we put our robes on over them to pronounce sentence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> And the sentence was?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> An acquittal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Again! Oh, the juries are crazy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> My dear, you express yourself just a little freely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bunerat.</span> Now, my dear Madame Vagret, you mustn't worry yourself.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>She leads her up the stage.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat</span> [<i>to Vagret</i>] Yes, my dear colleague, an acquittal. That makes
three this session.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>a man of forty, whiskered and foppish</i>] Three prisoners whom we
have had to set at liberty because we couldn't hold them for other
causes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> A regular run on the black!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole</span> [<i>a man of seventy</i>] My dear colleagues would prefer a run on
the red.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> La Bouzole, you are a cynic! I do not understand how you can
have the courage to joke on such a subject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> I shouldn't joke if your prisoners were condemned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I'm not thinking of our prisoners&mdash;I'm thinking of ourselves. If
you imagine we shall receive the congratulations of the Chancellery, you
are mistaken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> He doesn't care a straw if the Mauleon Court does earn a black
mark in Paris.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> You have said it, Bunerat; I don't care a straw! I have
nothing more to look for. I shall be seventy years old next week, and I
retire automatically. Nothing more to hope for; I have a right to judge
matters according to my own conscience. I'm out of school! [<i>He gives a
little skip</i>] Don't get your backs up&mdash;I've done&mdash;I see the Year Book
over there; I'm going to look out the dates of the coming vacation for
you. [<i>He takes a seat to the left</i>]<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> Well, there it is. [<i>To Vagret</i>] The President of Assizes is
furious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> It won't do him any good either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> And my substitute?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> You may well say "your substitute"!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> It's all his fault. He pleaded extenuating circumstances. He!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> Where does the idiot hail from?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> He's far from being an idiot, I assure you. He was secretary to
the Conference in Paris; he is a doctor of laws and full of talent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> Talent!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> I assure you he has a real talent for speaking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> So we observed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> He's a very distinguished young fellow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat</span> [<i>with emphasis</i>] Well! When a man has such talent as that he
becomes an advocate; he doesn't enter the magistracy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret</span> [<i>to La Bouzole, who approaches her</i>] So really, Monsieur
La Bouzole, it seems it's the fault of the new substitute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bunerat.</span> Tell us all about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> It was like this. [<i>He turns towards the ladies and
continues in a low tone. Bertha, who has entered the room, joins the
group, of which Vagret also forms one</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>to Bunerat</i>] All this won't hasten our poor Vagret's
nomination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat</span> [<i>smiling</i>] The fact is he hasn't a chance at the present
moment, poor chap!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Is it true that they were really seriously thinking of him when
there is a certain other magistrate in the same court?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat</span> [<i>with false modesty</i>] I don't think I&mdash;Of whom are you
speaking?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Of yourself, my dear President.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> They have indeed mentioned my name at the Ministry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> When you preside at Assizes the proceedings will be far more
interesting than they are at present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> Now how can you tell that, my dear Mouzon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Because I have seen you preside over the Correctional Court.
[<i>He laughs</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> Why do you laugh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I just remembered that witty remark of yours the other day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat</span> [<i>delighted</i>] I don't recall it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> It really was very witty! [<i>He laughs</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> What was it? Did I say anything witty? I don't remember.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Anything? A dozen things&mdash;a score. You were in form that day!
What a figure he cut&mdash;the prisoner. You know, the fellow who was so
badly dressed. Cock his name was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> Ah, yes! When I said: "Cock, turn yourself on and let your
confession trickle out!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>laughing</i>] That was it! That was it! And the witness for the
defence&mdash;that idiot. Didn't you make him look a fool? He couldn't finish
his evidence, they laughed so when you said: "If you wish to conduct the
case, only say so. Perhaps you'd like to take my place?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> Ah, yes! Ladies, my good friend here reminds me of a rather
amusing anecdote. The other day&mdash;it was in the Correctional Court&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Manservant</span> [<i>announcing</i>] Monsieur Gabriel Ardeuil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Scene VI</span>:&mdash;<i>The same, with Ardeuil.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardeuil</span> [<i>to Madame Vagret</i>] I hope you'll forgive me for coming so
late. I was detained until now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> I will forgive you all the more readily since I'm told
you have had such a success to-day as will make all the advocates of the
district jealous of you.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Ardeuil is left to himself.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole</span> [<i>touching him on the shoulder</i>] Young man&mdash;come, sit down by
me&mdash;as a favor. Do you realize that it won't take many trials like
to-day's to get you struck off the rolls?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardeuil.</span> I couldn't be struck off the rolls because&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> Hang it all&mdash;a man does himself no good by appearing
singular.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardeuil.</span> Singular! But you yourself&mdash;Well, the deliberations are secret,
but for all that I know you stand for independence and goodness of heart
in this Court.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> Yes, I've permitted myself that luxury&mdash;lately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardeuil.</span> Lately?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> Yes, yes, my young friend, for some little time. Because for
some little time I've been cured of the disease which turns so many
honest fellows into bad magistrates. That disease is the fever of
promotion. Look at those men there. If they weren't infected by this
microbe, they would be just, kindly gentlemen, instead of cruel and
servile magistrates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardeuil.</span> You exaggerate, sir. The French magistracy is not&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> It is not venal&mdash;that's the truth. Among our four thousand
magistrates you might perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> not find one&mdash;you hear me, not one&mdash;even
among the poorest and most obscure&mdash;who would accept a money bribe in
order to modify his judgment. That is the glory of our country's
magistracy and its special virtue. But a great number of our magistrates
are ready to be complaisant&mdash;even to give way&mdash;when it is a question of
making themselves agreeable to an influential elector, or to the deputy,
or to the minister who distributes appointments and favors. Universal
suffrage is the god and the tyrant of the magistrate. So you are
right&mdash;and I am not wrong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardeuil.</span> Nothing can deprive us of our independence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> That is so. But, as Monsieur de Tocqueville once remarked,
we can offer it up as a sacrifice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardeuil.</span> You are a misanthrope. There are magistrates whom no promise of
any kind&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> Yes, there are. Those who are not needy or who have no
ambitions. Yes, there are obscure persons who devote their whole lives
to their professions and who never ask for anything for themselves. But
you can take my word for it that they are the exceptions, and that our
Court of Mauleon, which you yourself have seen, represents about the
average of our judicial morality. I exaggerate, you think? Well! Let us
suppose that in all France there are only fifty Courts like this.
Suppose there are only twenty&mdash;suppose there is only one. It is still
one too many! Why, my young friend, what sort of an idea have you got of
the magistracy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardeuil.</span> It frightens me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> You are speaking seriously?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardeuil.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> Then why did you become a substitute?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardeuil.</span> Through no choice of my own! My people pushed me into the
profession.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> Yes. People look on the magistracy as a career. That is to
say, from the moment you enter it you have only one object&mdash;to get on.
[<i>A pause</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardeuil.</span> Yet it would be a noble thing&mdash;to dispense justice tempered
with mercy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> Yes&mdash;it should be. [<i>A pause</i>] Do you want the advice of a
man who has for forty years been a judge of the third class?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardeuil.</span> I should value it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> Send in your resignation. You have mistaken your vocation.
You wear the wrong robe. The man who attempts to put into practice the
ideas you have expressed must wear the priest's cassock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardeuil</span> [<i>as though to himself</i>] Yes&mdash;but for that one must have a
simple heart&mdash;a heart open to faith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat</span> [<i>who is with the others</i>] If only we had the luck to have a
deputy of the department for Keeper of the Seals! Just for a week!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole</span> [<i>to Ardeuil</i>] There, my boy, that's the sort of thing one
has to think about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Manservant</span> [<i>entering</i>] From his Honor the President of Assizes.
[<i>He gives Vagret a letter</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> He isn't coming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret</span> [<i>after reading the note</i>] He isn't coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> I hardly expected him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> A nervous headache he says. He left by the 6:49 train.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> That's significant!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bunerat.</span> It would be impossible to mark his disapproval more
clearly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> Three acquittals too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bunerat.</span> If it had been a question of celebrated pleaders! But
newly fledged advocates!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> Nobodies!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret</span> [<i>to her daughter</i>] My poor child! What will his report be
like?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertha.</span> What report?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Don't you know? At the close of each session the
President submits a report to the Minister&mdash;Ah, my dear Madame Bunerat!
[<i>The three women seat themselves at the back of the stage</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Three acquittals&mdash;and the Irissary murder. A deplorable record!
A pretty pickle we're in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> You know, my dear Vagret, I'm a plain speaker. No
shilly-shallying about me. When I hunt the boar I charge right down on
him. I speak plainly&mdash;anyone can know what's in my mind. I'm the son of
a peasant, I am, and I make no bones about it. Well, it seems to me that
your Bar&mdash;I know, of course, that you lead it with distinguished
integrity and honesty&mdash;but it seems to me&mdash;how shall I put it?&mdash;that
it's getting weak. Mouzon, you will remember, said the same thing when
he was consulting the statistics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> It really is a very bad year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> You know it was a question of making ourselves an exception to
the general rule&mdash;of getting our Court raised to a higher class. Well,
Mauleon won't be raised from the third class to the second if the number
of causes diminishes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> We should have to prove that we had been extremely busy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> And many of the cases you settled by arrangement might well
have been the subject of proceedings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Just reflect that this year we have awarded a hundred and
eighteen years less imprisonment than we did last year!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> And yet the Court has not been to blame. We safeguard the
interests of society with the greatest vigilance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> But before we can punish you must give us prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> I have recently issued the strictest orders respecting the
repression of smuggling offences, which are so common in these parts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> Well, that's something. You understand the point of view we
take. It's a question of the safety of the public, my dear fellow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> We are falling behind other Courts of the same class. See, I've
worked out the figures. [<i>He takes a paper from his pocket-book and
accidentally drops other papers, which La Bouzole picks up</i>] I see&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> You are dropping your papers, Mouzon. Is this yours&mdash;this
envelope? [<i>He reads</i>] "Monsieur Beno&icirc;t, Officer of the Navy, Railway
Hotel, Bordeaux." A nice scent&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>flurried, taking the letter from La Bouzole</i>] Yes&mdash;a letter
belonging to a friend of mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> And this? The Irissary murder?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Ah, yes&mdash;it's&mdash;I was going to explain&mdash;it's&mdash;oh, the Irissary
murder, yes&mdash;it's the translation Bunerat gave me of the article which
appeared in the <i>Eskual Herria</i> to-day. It is extremely unpleasant. They
say Mauleon is a sort of penal Court&mdash;something like a Biribi of the
magistracy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> But, after all, I can't invent a murderer for you just because
the fellow is so pig-headed that he won't allow himself to be taken!
Delorme has sent the description they gave us to the offices of all the
magistrates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Delorme! Shall I tell you what I think? Well, our colleague
Delorme is making a mistake in sticking to the idea that the criminal is
a tramp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> But there is a witness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> The witness is lying, or he's mistaken.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> A witness who saw gipsies leaving the victim's house that
morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I repeat, the witness is lying, or he is mistaken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Why so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I'm certain of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Because I'm certain the murderer wasn't a gipsy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> But explain&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> It's of no use, my dear friend. I know my duty to my colleague
Delorme too well to insist. I've said too much already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Not at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> By no means.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> It was with the greatest delicacy that I warned our colleague
Delorme&mdash;he was good enough to consult me and show me day by day the
information which he had elicited&mdash;I warned him that he was on a false
scent. He would listen to nothing; he persisted in searching for his
tramp. Well, let him search! There are fifty thousand tramps in France.
After all, I am probably wrong. Yet I should be surprised, for in the
big towns in which I have served as magistrate, and in which I found
myself confronted, not merely now and again, but every day, so to speak,
with difficulties of this sort, I was able to acquire a certain practice
in criminal cases and a certain degree of perspicacity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Obviously. As for Delorme, it is the first time he has had to
deal with such a big crime.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> In the case of that pretty woman from Toulouse, at Bordeaux, a
case which made a good deal of stir at the time, it was I who forced the
accused to make the confession that led her to the guillotine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat</span> [<i>admiringly</i>] Was it really?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> My dear friend, I ask you most seriously&mdash;and if I am insistent,
it is because I have reasons for being so&mdash;between ourselves, I beg you
to tell us on what you base your opinion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Well, I don't want to hide my light under a bushel&mdash;I'll tell
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> We are listening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Recall the facts. In a house isolated as are most of our Basque
houses they find, one morning, an old man of eighty-seven murdered in
his bed. Servants who slept in the adjacent building had heard nothing.
The dogs did not bark. There was robbery, it is true, but the criminal
did not confine himself to stealing hard cash; he stole family papers as
well. Remember that point. And I will call your attention to another
detail. It had rained on the previous evening. In the garden footprints
were discovered which were immediately attributed to the murderer, who
was so badly shod that the big toe of his right foot protruded from his
boot. Monsieur Delorme proceeds along the trail; he obtains a piece of
evidence that encourages him, and he declares that the murderer is a
vagrant. I say this is a mistake. The murderer is not a vagrant. Now the
house in which the crime was committed is an isolated house, and we know
that within a radius of six to ten miles there was no tramp begging
before the crime. So this tramp, if there was one, would have eaten and
drunk on the scene of the crime, either before or after striking the
blow. Now no traces have been discovered which permit us to suppose that
he did anything of the kind. So&mdash;here is a man who arrives in a state of
exhaustion. He begs; he is refused. He then hides himself, and, when it
is night, he robs and assassinates. There is wine and bread and other
food at hand; but he goes his way without touching them. Is this
probable? No. Don't tell me that he was disturbed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> and so ran off; it is
not true; their own witness declares that he saw him in the morning, a
few yards from the house, whereas the crime was committed before
midnight. If Monsieur Delorme, in addition to his distinguished
qualities, had a little experience of cases of this kind, he would
realize that empty bottles, dirty glasses, and scraps of food left on
the table constitute, so to speak, the sign manual which the criminal
vagrant leaves behind him on the scene of his crime.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> True; I was familiar with that detail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole</span> [<i>under his breath to Ardeuil</i>] That fellow would send a man
to the scaffold for the sake of seeming to know something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Go on&mdash;go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Monsieur Delorme ought to have known this also: in the life of
the vagrant there is one necessity which comes next to hunger and
thirst&mdash;it is the need of footwear. This is so true that they have
sometimes been known to make this need a pretext for demanding an
appeal, because the journey to the Court of Appeal is generally made on
foot, so that the administration is obliged to furnish shoes, and, as
these are scarcely worn during the period of detention, they are in good
condition when the man leaves prison. Now the supposed vagrant has a
foot very nearly the same size as that of his victim. He has&mdash;you
yourself have told us&mdash;boots which are in a very bad condition. Well,
gentlemen, this badly shod vagrant does not take the good strong boots
which are in the house! I will add but one word more. If the crime had
been committed by a passing stranger&mdash;by a professional mendicant&mdash;will
you tell me why this remarkable murderer follows the road which passes
in front of the victim's house&mdash;a road on which he would find no
resources&mdash;a road on which houses are met with only at intervals of two
or three miles&mdash;when there is, close at hand,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> another road which runs
through various villages and passes numbers of farmhouses, in which it
is a tradition never to refuse hospitality to one of his kind? One word
more. Why does this vagrant steal family papers which will betray him as
the criminal the very first time he comes into contact with the police?
No, gentlemen, the criminal is not a vagrant. If you want to find him,
you must not look for a man wandering along the highway; you must look
for him among those relatives or debtors or friends, who had an interest
in his death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> This is very true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> I call that admirably logical and extremely lucid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Believe me, the matter is quite simple. If I were intrusted with
the examination, I guarantee that within three days the criminal would
be under lock and key.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Well, my dear colleague, I have a piece of news for you.
Monsieur Delorme, who is very unwell, has returned me his brief this
afternoon, and it will be intrusted to you. Henceforth the preliminary
examination of the Irissary murder will be in your hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I have only to say that I accept. My duty is to obey. I withdraw
nothing of what I have said; within three days the murderer will be
arrested.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> Bravo!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> I thank you for that promise in the name of all concerned. I
declare that you relieve us of a great anxiety. [<i>To his wife</i>] Listen,
my dear. Monsieur Mouzon is undertaking the preliminary examination, and
he promises us a result before three days are up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> We shall be grateful, Monsieur Mouzon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bunerat.</span> Oh, thank you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Bertha! Tell them to serve dinner&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> to send up that old
Irrouleguy wine! I will drink to your success, my dear fellow.</p>

<h2>ACT II</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>In the office of Mouzon, the examining magistrate. A door
at the back and in the wall to the right. On the left are
two desks. Portfolios, armchairs, and one ordinary chair.</i></p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene I</span>:&mdash;<i>The recorder, then the doorkeeper, then Mouzon. When the
curtain rises the recorder, seated in the magistrate's armchair, is
drinking his coffee. The doorkeeper enters.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Ah! Here's our friend the doorkeeper of the courthouse! Well,
what's the news?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doorkeeper.</span> Here's your boss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Already!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doorkeeper.</span> He got back from Bordeaux last night. Fagged out he looked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder</span> [<i>loftily</i>] A Mauleon magistrate is always fatigued when he
returns from Bordeaux!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doorkeeper.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder</span> [<i>after a pause</i>] I do not know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doorkeeper.</span> It's the Irissary murder that has brought him here so early.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Probably. [<i>While speaking he arranges his cup, saucer, sugar
basin, etc., in a drawer. He then goes to his own place, the desk at the

Good-morning, your worship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Good-morning. You haven't made any engagements, have you, except
in the case of the Irissary murder?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> I have cited the officer of the gendarmerie, the accused, and
the wife of the accused.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I am tired, my good fellow. I have a nervous headache! Any
letters for me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> No, your worship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> His Honor the State Attorney hasn't asked for me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> No, your worship. But all the same I have something for you.
[<i>He hands him an envelope</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>opening the envelope</i>] Stamps for my collection! I say, Beno&icirc;t,
that's good! Now let's see. Let's see. [<i>He unlocks the drawer of his
desk and takes out a stamp album</i>] Uruguay. I have it! Well, it will do
to exchange. And this one too. Oh! Oh! I say, Beno&icirc;t! A George Albert,
first edition! But where did you get this, my dear fellow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> A solicitor's clerk found it in a brief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Splendid! I must stick that in at once! Pass me the paste, will
you? [<i>He delicately trims the edges of the stamp with a pair of
scissors and pastes it in the album with the greatest care, while still
talking</i>] It is rare, extremely rare! According to the <i>Philatelist</i> it
will exchange for three blue Amadei or a '67 Khedive, obliterated.
There! [<i>Turning over the leaves of his album</i>] Really, you know, it
begins to look something like. It's beginning to fill up, eh? You know I
believe I shall soon be able to get that Hayti example. Look! See here!
[<i>In great delight</i>] There's a whole page-full! And all splendid
examples. [<i>He closes the album and sighs</i>] O Lord!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> You don't feel well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> It's not that. I was rather worried at Bordeaux.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> About your stamps?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> No, no. [<i>A sigh to himself</i>] Damn the women! The very thing I
didn't want. [<i>He takes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span> his album again</i>] When I've got that Hayti
specimen I shall need only three more to fill this page too. Yes. [<i>He
closes the album</i>] Well, what's the post? Ah! Here is the information
from Paris in respect of the woman Etchepare and her husband's judicial
record. [<i>The doorkeeper enters with a visiting-card</i>] Who is coming to
disturb me now? [<i>More agreeably, having read the name</i>] Ah! Ah! [<i>To
the recorder</i>] I shall see him alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Yes, your worship. [<i>He goes out</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>to the doorkeeper</i>] Show him in. [<i>He hides his album, picks up
a brief, and affects to be reading it with the utmost attention</i>]</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene II</span>:&mdash;<i>Enter Mondoubleau.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau</span> [<i>speaking with a strong provincial accent</i>] I was passing
the Law Courts, and I thought I'd look in and say how do. I am not
disturbing you, I hope?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>smiling and closing his brief</i>] My dear deputy, an examining
magistrate, as you know, is always busy. But it gives one a rest&mdash;it
does one good&mdash;to see a welcome caller once in a while. Sit down, I beg
you. Yes, please!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> I can stop only a minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> But that's unkind of you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Well, what's the latest about the Irissary murder?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> So far there's nothing new. I've questioned the accused&mdash;an
ugly-looking fellow and a poor defence. He simply denied everything and
flew into a temper. I had to send him back to the cells without getting
anything out of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Are you perfectly sure you've got the right man?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Certain&mdash;no; but I should be greatly surprised if I were
mistaken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> I saw Monsieur Delorme yesterday. He's a little better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> So I hear. He thinks the murderer was a tramp. Now there, my
dear sir, is one of the peculiarities to which we examining magistrates
are subject. We always find it the very devil to abandon the first idea
that pops into our minds. Personally I do my best to avoid what is
really a professional failing. I am just going to examine Etchepare, and
I am waiting for the results of a police inquiry. If all this gives me
no result, I shall set the man at liberty and look elsewhere for the
culprit&mdash;but I repeat, I firmly believe I am on the right scent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Monsieur Delorme is a magistrate of long experience and a
very shrewd one, and I will not deny that the reasons he has given me
are&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I know my colleague is extremely intelligent. And, once more, I
don't say that he's wrong. We shall see. At present I am only morally
certain. I shall be materially certain when I know the antecedents of
the accused and have established an obvious motive for his action. At
the moment of your arrival I was about to open my mail. Here is a letter
from the Court of Pau; it gives our man's judicial record. [<i>He takes a
paper-knife in order to open the envelope</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> A curious paper-knife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> That? It's the blade of the knife that brought the pretty
Toulouse woman to the guillotine at Bordeaux. Pretty weapon, eh? I had
it made into a paper-knife. [<i>He opens the envelope</i>] There&mdash;there you
are! Four times sentenced for assaulting and wounding. You see&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Really, really! Four times!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> This is getting interesting. Besides this&mdash;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> have neglected
nothing&mdash;I have learned that his wife, Yanetta Etchepare&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Is that the young woman I saw in the corridor just now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I have called her as witness. I shall be hearing her directly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> She looks a very respectable woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Possibly. But, as I was about to tell you, I have learned that
she used to live in Paris&mdash;before her marriage&mdash;I have written asking
for information. Here we are. [<i>He opens the envelope and smiles</i>] Aha!
Well, this young woman who looks so respectable was sentenced to one
month's imprisonment for receiving stolen goods. Now we will hear the
police lieutenant who is coming, very obligingly, to give me an account
of the inquiry with which I intrusted him, and which he will put in
writing this evening. I shall soon see&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Do you suppose he will have anything new for you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Does this interest you? I will see him in your presence. [<i>He
goes to the door and makes a sign. He returns to his chair</i>] Understand,
I assert nothing. It is quite possible that my colleague's judgment has
been more correct than mine. [<i>The officer enters</i>]</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene III</span>:&mdash;<i>The same and the officer.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Good-morning, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Good-morning, lieutenant. You can speak before this gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer</span> [<i>saluting</i>] Our deputy&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Yes! He's the man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>after a glance at Mondoubleau</i>] Don't let's go too fast. On
what grounds do you make that assertion?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> You will see. In the first place there have been four
convictions already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Then fifteen years ago he bought, from Daddy Goyetche, the
victim, a vineyard, the payment taking the form of a life annuity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Well!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> He professed to have made a very bad bargain, and he used to
abuse old Goyetche as a swindler.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Excellent!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Five years ago he sold this vineyard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> So that for five years he has been paying an annuity to the
victim, although the vineyard was no longer his property.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Yes, your worship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> After his arrest people's tongues were loosened. His neighbors
have been talking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> That's always the way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> I have heard a witness, the girl Gracieuse Mendione, to whom
Etchepare used the words, "It is really too stupid to be forced to pay
money to that old swine."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Wait a moment. You say the girl Gracieuse?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Mendione.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>writing</i>] Mendione&mdash;"It is really too stupid to be forced to
pay money to that old swine." Good! Good! Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> I have another witness, Piarrech Artola.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>writing</i>] Piarrech Artola.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Etchepare told him, about two months ago, in speaking of old
Goyetche, "It's more than one can stand&mdash;the Almighty's forgotten him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>writing</i>] "The Almighty has forgotten him." Excellent. Is this
all you can tell me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Almost all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> At what date should Etchepare have made the next annual payment
to old Goyetche?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> A week after Ascension Day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> That is a week after the crime?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Yes, your worship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>to Mondoubleau</i>] Singular coincidence! [<i>To the officer</i>] Was
he comfortably off, this Etchepare?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> He was pressed for money. Three months ago he borrowed eight
hundred francs from a Mauleon cattle-dealer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> And what do the neighbors say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> They say Etchepare was a sly grasping fellow, and they aren't
surprised to hear that he's the murderer. All the same, they all speak
very highly of the woman Yanetta Etchepare. They say she is a model
mother and housekeeper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> How many children?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Two&mdash;Georges and&mdash;I can't remember the name of the other now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> And the woman's moral character?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Irreproachable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> I was forgetting. One of my men, one of those who effected the
arrest, informs me that when Etchepare saw him coming he said to his
wife, "They've got me."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> "They've got me." That is rather important.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> And then he told his wife, in Basque, "Don't for the world let
out that I left the house last night!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> He said this before the gendarme?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> No, your worship&mdash;the gendarme was outside&mdash;close to an open
window. Etchepare didn't see him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> You will have him cited as witness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Yes, your worship. Then there's that witness for the defence
too&mdash;Bridet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Ah, yes&mdash;I have read the deposition he made in your presence.
It's of no importance. Still, if he's there I'll hear him. Thank you.
Well, draw up a report for me, in full detail, and make them give you
the summonses for the witnesses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Yes, your worship. [<i>He salutes and goes out</i>]</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene IV</span>:&mdash;<i>Mouzon and Mondoubleau.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Monsieur Delorme is a fool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>laughing</i>] Well, I don't say so, my dear deputy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> It's wonderful, your faculty of divination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Wonderful&mdash;no, no. I assure you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Now how did you come to suspect this Etchepare?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Well, you know, it is partly a matter of temperament. The
searching for a criminal is an art. I may say that a good examining
magistrate is guided less by the facts themselves than by a kind of
inspiration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Wonderful. I repeat it's wonderful. And this witness for
the defence?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> He may be a false witness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> What makes you think that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Because he accuses the gipsies! Moreover, he had business
dealings with Etchepare. The Basque, you know, still look on us rather
as enemies, as conquerors, and they think it no crime to deceive us by
means of a false oath.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Then you were never inclined to accept the theory of your
predecessor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Tramps&mdash;the poor wretches! I know what an affection you have for
the poor, and I feel with you that one should not confine oneself to
suspecting the unfortunate&mdash;people without shelter, without bread even.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Bravo! I am delighted to find that you are not only an able
magistrate, but also that you think with me on political matters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> You are very good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> I hope that from now on the Basque newspapers will cease
its attacks upon you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I am afraid not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Come, come!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> What can you expect, my dear sir? The paper is hostile to you,
and as I do not scruple openly to support your candidature they make the
magistrate pay for the opinions of the citizen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> I feel ashamed&mdash;and I thank you with all my heart, my dear
fellow. Go on as you are doing&mdash;but be prudent&mdash;eh? The Keeper of the
Seals was saying to me only a couple of days ago, "I look to you to see
that there is no trouble in your constituency. No trouble&mdash;above all no
scandal of any kind!" I ought to tell you that Eug&egrave;ne is the subject of
many attacks at the present moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> You are on very intimate terms with his Honor the Keeper of the
Seals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau</span> [<i>makes a gesture, then, simply</i>] We were in the Commune
together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Tell me, by the way, what sort of a man is your State
Attorney?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Monsieur Vagret?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Yes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Oh, well&mdash;he's a very painstaking magistrate, very exact&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> No, I mean as to his political opinions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> You mustn't blame him for being in the political camp of those
who are diametrically opposed to us. At all events, don't run away with
the idea that he is a mischievous person.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Narrow-minded. [<i>He has for some little time been gazing at
Mouzon's desk</i>] I see you've got the Labastide brief on your table.
There's nothing in it at all. I know Labastide well; he's one of my
ablest electoral agents; and I assure you he's absolutely incapable of
committing the actions of which he is accused. I told Monsieur Vagret as
much, but I see he is prosecuting after all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I can only assure you, my dear deputy, that I will give the
Labastide affair my most particular attention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> I have too much respect for you, my dear fellow, to ask
more of you. Well, well, I mustn't waste your time. So for the present&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Au revoir. [<i>The deputy goes out. Mouzon is alone</i>] I don't
think our deputy is getting such a bad idea of me. [<i>Smiling</i>] The fact
is it was really clever of me to suspect Etchepare. Now the thing is to
make him confess the whole business, and as quickly as possible&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The doorkeeper enters, a telegram in his hand.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> A telegram for me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doorkeeper.</span> Yes, your honor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Give it me. Right. [<i>The doorkeeper goes out. Mouzon reads</i>]
"Diane is detained under arrest. The report of yesterday's affair sent
to the Attorney-General.&mdash;Lucien." That's nice for me! [<i>He is silent,
pacing to and fro</i>] Oh, the accursed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> women! [<i>Silence</i>] Come, I must
get to work. [<i>He goes to the door at the back and calls his recorder</i>]
Beno&icirc;t!</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene V</span>:&mdash;<i>Mouzon, the recorder, and then Bridet.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>seated, gives a brief to the recorder</i>] Make out an order of
non-lieu in the Labastide case and the order for his immediate release.
You can do that during the interrogatories. Now, let us begin! It is two
o'clock already and we have done nothing. Make haste&mdash;Let's see&mdash;What
are you waiting for? Give me the list of witnesses&mdash;the list of
witnesses. Don't you understand? What's the matter with you to-day?
That's right. Now bring in this famous witness for the defence and let
us get rid of him. Is Etchepare there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Yes, your honor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> His wife too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Yes, your honor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Well, then! What's the matter with you that you look at me like
that? Bring him in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Which first? Etchepare?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> No!&mdash;the witness for the defence. The wit-ness for the
de-fence&mdash;do you understand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder</span> [<i>outside, angrily</i>] Bridet! Come, Bridet, are you deaf? Come
in! [<i>Roughly</i>] Stir yourself!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Bridet enters.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> Your worship, I am going to tell you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Hold your tongue. You will speak when you are questioned. Name,
surname, age, profession, and place of domicile.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> Bridet, Jean-Pierre, thirty-eight, maker of <i>alpargates</i> at
Faigorry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>in a single breath</i>] You swear to speak the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth. Say,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> "I swear." You are neither a
blood relative nor a relation by marriage of the accused, you are not in
his service and he is not in yours. [<i>To the recorder</i>] Has he said, "I
swear"?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Yes, your worship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>to Bridet</i>] Speak! [<i>Silence</i>] Go on&mdash;speak!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> I am waiting for you to ask me questions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Just now one couldn't keep you quiet; now when I ask you to
speak you have nothing to say. What interest have you in defending
Etchepare?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> What interest?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Yes. Don't you understand your own language?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> Yes, Monsieur. Why, no interest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> No interest? Is that the truth? Eh? None? Come, I want very much
to believe you. [<i>Very sternly</i>] However, I remind you that Article 361
of the Penal Code punishes false evidence with imprisonment. Now that
you know the risk you run in not telling the truth I will listen to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet</span> [<i>confused</i>] I was going to say that old Goyetche was murdered by
gipsies who came from over the frontier, down the mountain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> You are sure of that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> I believe it's so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> You are not here to say what you believe. Tell me what you saw
or heard. That is all that's asked of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> But one's always meeting them, these gipsies. The other day they
robbed a tobacconist's shop. There were three of them. Two of them went
inside. I must tell you they had looked the place over during the day&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Did you come here to laugh at the law? Eh?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> I?&mdash;But, Monsieur&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I ask if you came here to mock at the law?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> No, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> That's as well, for such a thing won't answer&mdash;you understand?
Do you hear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> Yes, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Is that all you have to say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> No, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Well, then, go on! Confound it! Don't waste my time in this way!
Do you think I've nothing to do but listen to your gossip? Come now,
tell me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> Well, the day after Ascension Day&mdash;that is, on the Monday&mdash;no,
on the Friday&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Was it Monday or Friday?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> Friday&mdash;it was like a Monday, you see, because it was the day
after the holiday. Well, the day they found old Goyetche murdered I saw
a troop of gipsies leaving his house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Then you were quite close to the house?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> No, I was passing on the road.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Did they close the door behind them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> I don't know, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Then why do you say you saw them come out of the house?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> I saw them come out of the meadow in front of the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> And then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> That's all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>throwing himself back in his chair</i>] And you've come here to
bother me for this, eh? Answer. For this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> But, your worship&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;I thought&mdash;I beg your
pardon&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Listen. How many gipsies were there? Think well. Don't make a
mistake.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> Five.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Are you certain of that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> Yes, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Yes. Well, in the presence of the gendarmes you said there were
five or six. So you are more certain of a fact at the end of a month
than you were on the day on which you observed it. On the other hand,
you no longer know whether the fact occurred on a Monday or a Friday,
nor whether the gipsies were leaving the house or merely crossing the
fields. [<i>Sternly</i>] Tell me, are you acquainted with the accused?
Etchepare&mdash;do you know him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> Yes, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> You have business relations with him? You used to sell him
sheep?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> Yes, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> That's enough for me. Get out!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> Yes, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> And think yourself lucky that I let you go like this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> Yes, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> In future, before asking to be heard as a witness for the
defence in a trial at law, I recommend you to think twice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> Rest your mind easy, Monsieur. I swear they'll never get me
again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Sign your interrogatory and be off. If there were not so many
easy-going blunderers of your sort, there would be less occasion to
complain of the law's delays and hesitations for which the law itself is
not responsible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridet.</span> Yes, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>to the recorder</i>] Send for Etchepare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder</span> [<i>returning immediately</i>] Your worship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Is he there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Yes, your honor. He would like to see you before the
interrogatory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Well, show him in, then! What are you waiting for? Be off&mdash;and
come back when I send for the accused.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Good-day, my dear fellow&mdash;how are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pla&ccedil;at.</span> Fine. And you? I caught sight of you last night at the Grand

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Ah, yes&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pla&ccedil;at.</span> I beg your pardon. Tell me now&mdash;I wanted to have a word with you
about the Etchepare case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> If you are free at the present moment, we are going to hold the
examination at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pla&ccedil;at.</span> That's the trouble&mdash;I haven't a minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Would you like us to postpone it until to-morrow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pla&ccedil;at.</span> No, no&mdash;I have just been speaking to the accused. An
uninteresting story. He just keeps on denying&mdash;that's all. He agreed to
be interrogated without me. [<i>Laughing</i>] I won't hide from you that I
advised him to persist in his method. Well, then, au revoir. If he wants
an advocate later on, let me know&mdash;I'll send you one of my secretaries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Right. Good-bye for the present, then.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Scene VII</span>:&mdash;<i>Mouzon, Etchepare, the recorder.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Step forward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>to the recorder</i>] Recorder, write. [<i>Very quickly, stuttering</i>]
In the year nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, etc. Before me, Mouzon,
examining magistrate, in the presence of&mdash;and so on&mdash;the Sieur Etchepare
Jean-Pierre was brought to our office, his first appearance being
recorded in the report of&mdash;and so on. We may mention that the accused,
having consented to interrogation in the absence of his advocate&mdash;[<i>To
Etchepare</i>] You do consent, don't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> I am innocent. I don't need any advocate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>resumes his stuttering</i>] We dispensed therewith. In consequence
of which we have immediately proceeded as below to the interrogation of
the said Sieur Etchepare Jean-Pierre. [<i>To Etchepare</i>] Etchepare, on the
occasion of your first appearance you refused to reply, which wasn't
perhaps very sensible of you, but you were within your rights. You lost
your temper and I was even obliged to remind you of the respect due to
the law. Are you going to speak to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare</span> [<i>disturbed</i>] Yes, your worship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Ah! Aha! my fine fellow, you are not so proud to-day!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> No. I've been thinking. I want to get out of this as quickly
as possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Well, well, for my part, I ask nothing more than to be able to
set you at liberty. So far we understand each other excellently. Let us
hope it'll last. Sit down. And first of all I advise you to give up
trying to father the crime onto a band of gipsies. The witness Bridet,
who has business relations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> with you, has endeavored, no doubt at your
instigation, to induce us to accept this fable. I warn you he has not
succeeded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> I don't know what Bridet may have told you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Oh! You deny it? So much the better! Come, you are cleverer than
I thought! Was it you who murdered Goyetche?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> No, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> You had an interest in his death?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> No, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Oh, really! I thought you had to pay him a life annuity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare</span> [<i>after a moment's hesitation</i>] Yes, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Then you had an interest in his death? [<i>Silence</i>] Eh! You don't
answer? Well, let us continue. You said to a witness, the young
woman&mdash;the young woman Gracieuse Mendione&mdash;"It is really too stupid to
be forced to pay money to that old swine."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare</span> [<i>without conviction</i>] That's not true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> It's not true! So the witness is a liar, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> You don't know. [<i>A pause</i>] You thought that Goyetche had lived
too long?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> No, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> No, Monsieur. Then why did you say to another witness, Piarrech
Artola, why did you say, in speaking of your creditor, "It's too much,
the Almighty has forgotten him"?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> I didn't say that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> You didn't say that. So this witness is a liar too! Answer me.
Is he a liar? [<i>Silence</i>] You don't answer. It's just as well. Come now,
Etchepare, why do you persist in these denials&mdash;eh? Isn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> it all plain
enough? You are avaricious, interested, greedy for gain&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> It's so hard to make a living.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> You are a man of violent temper&mdash;from time to time you get
drunk, and then you become dangerous. You have been four times convicted
for assault and wounding&mdash;you are over-ready with your knife. Is that
the truth or isn't it? You were tired of paying&mdash;for nothing&mdash;a biggish
annual sum to this old man. The time for payment was approaching; you
were pressed for money; you felt that Goyetche had lived too long, and
you killed him. It's so obvious&mdash;eh? Isn't it true?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare</span> [<i>gradually recovering himself</i>] I did not murder him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> We won't juggle with words. Did you pay anyone else to kill him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> I had nothing to do with his death. You yourself say I was
pressed for money. So how could I have paid anyone to kill him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Then you did it yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> That's a lie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Listen, Etchepare&mdash;you will confess sooner or later. Already you
are weakening in your defence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> If I was to shout, you'd say I was play-acting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I tell you sooner or later you will change your tune. Already
you admit facts which constitute a serious charge against you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> That's true; I said it without thinking of the consequences.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Ah, but you ought to think of the consequences; for they may be
peculiarly serious for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> I'm not afraid of death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> The death of others<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> Nor my own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> So much the better. But you are a Basque; you are a Catholic.
After death there is hell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> I'm not afraid of hell; I've done nothing wrong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> There is the dishonor that will fall on your children. You love
your children, do you not? Eh? They will ask after you&mdash;they love
you&mdash;because they don't know&mdash;yet&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare</span> [<i>suddenly weeping</i>] My poor little children! My poor little
children!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Come, then! All good feeling isn't extinct in you. Believe me,
Etchepare, the jury will be touched by your confession, by your
repentance&mdash;you will escape the supreme penalty. You are still
young&mdash;you have long years before you in which to expiate your crime.
You may earn your pardon and perhaps you may once again see those
children, who will have forgiven you. Believe me&mdash;believe me&mdash;in your
own interests even, confess! [<i>Mouzon has approached Etchepare during
the foregoing; he places his hands on the latter's shoulders; he
continues, with great gentleness</i>] Come, isn't it true? If you can't
speak, you've only to nod your head. Eh? It's true? Come, since I know
it's true. Eh? I can't hear what you say. It was you, wasn't it? It was
you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare</span> [<i>still weeping</i>] It was not me, sir! I swear it was not me! I
swear it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>in a hard voice, going back to his desk</i>] Oh, you needn't
swear. You have only to tell me the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> I am telling the truth&mdash;I am&mdash;I can't say I did it when I
didn't!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Come, come! We shall get nothing out of you to-day. [<i>To the
recorder</i>] Read him his interrogatory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> and let him be taken back to his
cell. One minute&mdash;Etchepare!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> Monsieur?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> There is one way to prove your innocence, since you profess to
be innocent. Prove, in one way or another, that you were elsewhere than
at Irissary on the night of the crime, and I will set you at liberty.
Where were you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> Where was I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I ask you where you were on the night of Ascension Day. Were you
at home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Is that really the truth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>rising, rather theatrically, pointing at Etchepare</i>] Now,
Etchepare, that condemns you. I know that you went out that night. When
you were arrested you said to your wife, "Don't for the world admit that
I went out last night." Come, I must tell you everything. Someone saw
you&mdash;a servant. She told the gendarmes that as she was saying good-night
to a young man from Iholdy, with whom she had been dancing, at ten
o'clock at night, she saw you a few hundred yards from your house. What
have you to say to that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> It is true&mdash;I did go out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>triumphantly</i>] Ah! Now, my good man, we've had some trouble in
getting you to say something. But I can read it in your face when you
are lying&mdash;I can read it in your face in letters as big as that. The
proof is that there was no witness who saw you go out&mdash;neither your
servant nor anyone else; and yet I would have sworn to it with my head
under the knife. Come, we have made a little progress now. [<i>To the
recorder</i>] Have you put down carefully his first admission? Good. [<i>To
Etchepare</i>] Now think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> for a moment. We will continue our little
conversation. [<i>He goes towards the fireplace, rubbing his hands, pours
himself a glass of spirits, swallows it, gives a sigh of gratification,
and returns to his chair</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Gendarme</span> [<i>to his comrade</i>] A cunning one, he is!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Gendarme.</span> You're right!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Let us continue. Come, now that you've got so far, confess the
whole thing! Here are these good gendarmes who want to go to their grub.
[<i>The gendarmes, the recorder, and Mouzon laugh</i>] You confess? No? Then
tell me, why did you insist on saying that you remained at home that
night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> Because I'd told the gendarmes so and I didn't want to make
myself out a liar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> And why did you tell the gendarmes that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> Because I thought they'd arrest me on account of the
smuggling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Good. Then you didn't go to Irissary that night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Where did you go?</p>

<p>ETCHEPARE. Up the mountain, to look for a horse that had got away the
night before, one of a lot we were taking to Spain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Good. Excellent. That isn't badly thought out&mdash;that can be
maintained. You went to look for a horse lost on the mountain, a horse
which escaped from a lot you were smuggling over the frontier on the
previous night. Excellent. If that is true, there is nothing for it but
to set you at liberty before we are much older. Now to prove that you've
simply to tell me to whom you sold the horse; we shall send for the
purchaser, and if he confirms your statement, I will sign your
discharge. To whom did you sell the horse?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> I didn't sell it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> You gave it away? You did something with it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> No&mdash;I didn't find it again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> You didn't find it again! The devil! That's not so good. Come!
Let's think of something else. You didn't go up the mountain all alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> Yes, all alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Bad luck! Another time, you see, you ought to take a companion.
Were you out long?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> All night. I got in at five in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> A long time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> We aren't well off, and a horse is worth a lot of money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Yes. But you didn't spend the whole night on the mountain
without meeting someone&mdash;shepherds or customs officers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> It was raining in torrents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Then you met no one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> No one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I thought as much. [<i>In a tone of disappointed reproach, with
apparent pity</i>] Tell me, Etchepare, do you take the jurymen for idiots?
[<i>Silence</i>] So that's all you've been able to think of? I said you were
intelligent just now. I take that back. But think what you've told me&mdash;a
rigmarole like that. Why, a child of eight would have done better. It's
ridiculous I tell you&mdash;ridiculous. The jurymen will simply shrug their
shoulders when they hear it. A whole night out of doors, in the pouring
rain, to look for a horse you don't find&mdash;and without meeting a living
soul&mdash;no shepherds, no customs officers&mdash;and you go home at five in the
morning&mdash;although at this time of the year it's daylight by then&mdash;yes,
and before then&mdash;but no, no one saw you and you saw no one. So everybody
was stricken with blindness, eh? A miracle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span> happened, and everyone was
blind that night. You don't ask me to believe that? No? Why not? It's
quite as probable as what you do tell me. So everybody wasn't blind?
[<i>The recorder bursts into a laugh; the gendarmes imitate him</i>] You see
what it's worth, your scheme of defence! You make the gaolers and my
recorder laugh. Don't you agree with me that your new method of defence
is ridiculous?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare</span> [<i>abashed, under his breath</i>] I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Well, if you don't know, we do! Come now! I have no advice to
give you. You repeat that at the trial and see what effect you produce.
But why not confess? Why not confess? I really don't understand your
obstinacy. I repeat, I really do not understand it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> Well, if I didn't do it, am I to say all the same that I did?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> So you persist in your story of the phantom horse? You persist
in it, do you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> How do I know? How should I know what I ought to say? I
should do better not to say anything at all&mdash;everything I say is turned
against me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Because the stories you invent are altogether too
improbable&mdash;because you think me more of a fool than I am in thinking
that I am going to credit such absurd inventions. I preferred your first
method; at least you had two witnesses to speak for you&mdash;two witnesses
who were not worth very much, it's true, but witnesses all the same.
You've made a change; well, you are within your rights. Let us stick to
the lost horse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> Well, then? [<i>A long pause</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Come! Out with it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare</span> [<i>without emphasis, hesitation, gazing at the recorder as
though to read in his eyes whether he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> replying as he should</i>] Well,
I'm going to tell you, Monsieur. You are right&mdash;it isn't true&mdash;I didn't
go up into the mountain. What I said first of all was the truth&mdash;I
didn't go out at all. Just now I was all muddled. At first I denied
everything, even what was true&mdash;I was so afraid of you. Then, when you
told me&mdash;I don't remember what it was&mdash;my head's all going like&mdash;I don't
know&mdash;I don't remember&mdash;but all the same I know I am innocent. Well,
just now, I almost wished I could admit I was guilty if only you'd leave
me in peace. What was I saying? I don't remember. Ah, yes&mdash;when you told
me&mdash;whatever it was, I've forgotten&mdash;it seemed to me I'd better say I'd
gone out&mdash;and I told a lie. But [<i>sincerely</i>] what I swear to you is
that I am not the guilty man. I swear it, I swear it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I repeat, I ask nothing better than to be able to believe it. So
now it's understood, is it, that you were at home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> Yes, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> We shall hear your wife directly. You have no other witnesses to
call?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> No, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Good. Take the accused away&mdash;but remain in the Court. I shall
probably need him directly for a confrontation. His interrogatory isn't
finished.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The gendarmes lead Etchepare away.</i></p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene VIII</span>:&mdash;<i>Mouzon and the recorder.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>to the recorder</i>] What a rogue, eh? One might have taken him in
the act, knife in hand, and he'd say it wasn't true! A crafty fellow
too&mdash;he defends himself well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> I really thought, at one time, that your worship had got him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> When I was speaking of his children?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Yes, that brought tears to one's eyes. It made one feel one
wanted to confess even though one hadn't done anything!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Didn't it? Ah, if I hadn't got this headache! [<i>A pause</i>] I did
a stupid thing just now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Oh, your worship!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I did. I was wrong to show him how improbable that new story of
his was. It is so grotesque that it would have betrayed him&mdash;while, if
he goes on asserting that he never left the house, if the servant
insists he didn't, and if the wife says the same thing, that's something
that may create a doubt in the mind of the jury. He saw that perfectly,
the rascal! He felt that of the two methods the first was the better.
That's one against me, my good Beno&icirc;t. [<i>To himself</i>] That must be set
right. Let me think. Etchepare is the murderer, there's no doubt about
that. I am as certain of that as if I'd been present. So he wasn't at
home on the night of the crime and his wife knows it. After the way he
hesitated just now&mdash;if I can get the wife to confess that he was absent
from home till the morning, we get back to the ridiculous story of the
lost horse, and I catch him twice in a flagrant lie, and I've got him.
Come, we must give the good woman a bit of a roasting and get the truth
out of her. It'll be devilish queer if I don't succeed. [<i>To the
recorder</i>] What did I do with the police record of the woman Etchepare
that was sent from Paris?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> It's in the brief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Yes&mdash;here it is&mdash;the extract from her judicial record. Report
number two, a month of imprisonment, for receiving&mdash;couldn't be better.
Send her in.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The recorder goes to the door and calls.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Yanetta Etchepare!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Enter Yanetta.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene IX</span>:&mdash;<i>Mouzon, recorder, Yanetta.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Step forward. Now, Madame, I shall not administer the oath to
you, since you are the wife of the accused. But none the less I beg you
most urgently to tell the truth. I warn you that an untruth on your part
might compel me to accuse you of complicity with your husband in the
crime of which he is accused and force me to have you arrested at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> I'm not afraid. I can't be my husband's accomplice because my
husband isn't guilty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> That is not my opinion. I will say further: you know a great
deal more about this matter than you care to tell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> I? That's infamous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Come, come, no shouting! I don't say you took a direct part in
the murder, I say it is highly probable that you knew of the murder,
perhaps advised it, and that you have profited by it. That would be
enough to place you in the dock beside your husband at the assizes. My
treatment of you will depend on the sincerity of your answers to my
questions. As you do or do not tell me the truth I shall either set you
at liberty or have you arrested. Now you can't say that I haven't warned
you! And now, if you please, inform me whether you persist in your first
statement, in which you affirm that Etchepare stopped at home on the
night of Ascension Day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Well, it is untrue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta</span> [<i>excited</i>] The night on which Daddy Goyetche was murdered my
husband never left the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I tell you that is not the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta</span> [<i>as before</i>] The night Daddy Goyetche was murdered my husband
never left the house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> You seem to have got stuck. You go on repeating the same thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Yes, I go on repeating the same thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Well, now let us examine into the value of your evidence. Since
your marriage&mdash;for the last ten years&mdash;your conduct has left nothing to
be desired. You are thrifty, faithful, industrious, honest&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Wait a moment. You have two children, whom you adore. You are an
excellent mother. One hears of your almost heroic behavior at the time
your eldest child was ill&mdash;Georges, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Yes, it was Georges. But what has that to do with the charge
against my husband?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Have patience. You will see presently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Very well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> It is all the more to your credit that you are what you are, for
your husband does not give us an example of the same virtues. He
occasionally gets drunk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> No, he doesn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Come&mdash;everyone knows that. He is violent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> He's not violent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> So violent that he has been convicted four times for assault and
battery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> That's possible; at holiday times, in the evening, men get
quarrelling. But that was a long time ago. Now he behaves better, and
I'm very happy with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> That surprises me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Anyhow, does that prove he murdered old Goyetche?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Your husband is very grasping.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Poor people are forced to be very grasping or else to die of
starvation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> You defend him well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Did you suppose I was going to accuse him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Have you ever been convicted?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta</span> [<i>anxious</i>] Me?</p>

<p>Mouzon. Yes, you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta</span> [<i>weakly</i>] No, I've never been convicted.</p>

<p>Mouzon. That is curious because there was a girl of your name in Paris
who was sentenced to a month's imprisonment for receiving stolen
property.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta</span> [<i>weakly</i>] For receiving stolen property&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> You are not quite so bold now&mdash;you are disturbed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta</span> [<i>as before</i>] No&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> You are pale&mdash;you are trembling&mdash;you are feeling faint. Give her
a chair, Beno&icirc;t. [<i>The recorder obeys</i>] Pull yourself together!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> My God, you know that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Here is the report which has been sent me. "The woman Yanetta
X&mdash;was brought to Paris at the age of sixteen as companion or lady's
maid by Monsieur and Madame So-and-so, having been employed by them in
that capacity at Saint-Jean-de-Luz." Is that correct?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Here is some more. "Illicit relations were before long formed
between the girl Yanetta and the son of the family, who was twenty-three
years of age. Two years later the lovers fled, taking with them eight
thousand francs which the young man had stolen from his father. On the
information of the latter the girl Yanetta was arrested and condemned to
one month's imprisonment for receiving stolen property. After serving
her sentence she disappeared. It is believed that she returned to her
own district." Are you the person mentioned here?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Yes. My God, I thought that was all so long ago&mdash;so completely
forgotten. It is all true, Monsieur, but for ten years now I've given
every minute of my life to making up for it, trying to redeem myself.
Just now I answered you insolently; I beg your pardon. You have not only
my life in your hands now, but my husband's, and the honor of my
children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Does your husband know of this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> No, Monsieur. Oh, you aren't going to tell him! I beg you on my
knees! It would be wicked, I tell you, wicked! Listen, Monsieur&mdash;listen.
I came back to the country; I hid myself; I would rather have died; I
didn't want to stay in Paris&mdash;you understand why&mdash;and then in a little
while I lost mother. Etchepare was in love with me, and he bothered me
to marry him. I refused&mdash;I had the courage to go on refusing for three
years. Then&mdash;I was so lonely, so miserable, and he was so unhappy, that
in the end I gave way. I ought to have told him everything. I wanted to,
but I couldn't. It would have hurt him too much. For he's a good man,
Monsieur, I swear he is. [<i>Mouzon makes a gesture</i>] Yes, I know,
sometimes when he's been drinking, he's violent. I was going to tell you
about that. I don't want to tell you any more untruths. But it's very
seldom he's violent now. [<i>Weeping</i>] Oh, don't let him know, Monsieur,
don't let him know. He'd go away&mdash;he'd leave me&mdash;he'd take my children
from me. [<i>She gives a despairing cry</i>] Ah, he'd take my children from
me! I don't know what to say to you&mdash;but it isn't possible&mdash;you can't
tell him&mdash;now you know all the harm it would do. You won't? Of course I
was guilty&mdash;but I didn't understand&mdash;I didn't know. I wasn't seventeen,
sir, when I went to Paris. My master and mistress had a son; he forced
me almost&mdash;and I loved him&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span> then he wanted to take me away because
his parents wanted to send him away by himself. I did what he asked me.
That money&mdash;I didn't know he had stolen it&mdash;I swear I didn't know&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> That's all right; control yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Yes, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> We'll put that on one side for the moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Yes, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Now your husband&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Yes, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>with great sincerity</i>] You will have need of all your courage,
my poor woman. Your husband is guilty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> It's impossible! It's impossible!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>with great sincerity</i>] He has not confessed it, but he is on
the point of doing so. I myself know what happened that night after he
left your house&mdash;witnesses have told me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> No! No! My God, my God! Witnesses? What witnesses? It isn't
true!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Well, then, don't be so obstinate! In your own interest, don't
be so stubborn! Shall I tell you what will be the end of it? You will
ruin your husband! If you insist on contradicting the evidence, that he
passed the night away from the house, you'll ruin him, I tell you. On
the other hand, if you will only tell me the truth, then if he is not
the murderer, he will tell us what he did do and who his companions
were.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> He hadn't any.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Then he went out alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> At ten o'clock?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> At ten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> He returned alone at five in the morning?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Yes, all alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> But perhaps you are thinking of some other night. It was really
the night of Ascension Day when he went out alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Beno&icirc;t, have you got that written down?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Yes, your worship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Madame, I know how painful this must be to you, but I beg you to
listen to me with the greatest attention. Your husband was pressed for
money, was he not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> I tell you no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Here is the proof. Three months ago he borrowed eight hundred
francs from a cattle-dealer of Mauleon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> He never told me about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Moreover, he owed a considerable sum to Goyetche.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> I've never heard of that either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Here is an acknowledgment written by your husband. It is in his
handwriting?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Yes, but I didn't know&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> You didn't know of the existence of this debt? That tends to
confirm what I know already&mdash;your husband went to Irissary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> No, sir; he tells me everything he does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> But you see very well that he doesn't, since you didn't know of
the existence of this debt. He went to Irissary. Don't you believe me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Yes, Monsieur, but he didn't kill a man for money; it's a lie,
a lie, a lie!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> It's a lie! Now how am I to know that? Your husband begins by
denying everything, blindly, and then he takes up two methods of defence
in succession.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> You yourself begin by a piece of false evidence. All
this, I tell you again, will do for the man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> I don't know about that, but what I do tell you again is that
he didn't kill a man for money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Then what did he kill him for? Perhaps after all he isn't as
guilty as I supposed just now. Perhaps he acted without premeditation.
This is what might have happened. Etchepare, a little the worse for
drink, goes to Goyetche in order to ask him once more to wait for the
payment of this debt. There is a dispute between the two men; old
Goyetche was still a strong man; there may have been provocation on his
part, and there may have been a struggle, with the tragic result you
know of. In that case your husband's position is entirely different&mdash;he
is no longer a criminal premeditating a crime; and the sentence
pronounced against him may be quite a light one. So you see, my good
woman, how greatly it is in your interest to obtain a complete
confession from him. If he persists in his denials, I am afraid the jury
will be extremely severe upon him. There is no doubt that he killed
Goyetche; but under what conditions did he kill him? Everything depends
on that. By persistently trying to pass for a totally innocent man he
risks being thought more guilty than he is. Do you understand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Yes, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Will you speak to him as I suggest? Shall I send for him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Yes, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> [<i>to the recorder</i>] Bring in the accused. Tell the gendarmes I
shall not need them.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Etchepare enters.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene X</span>:&mdash;<i>The same, Etchepare.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Pierre! To see you here&mdash;my Pierre&mdash;a prisoner&mdash;like a thief!
My poor husband&mdash;my poor husband! Oh, prove you haven't done anything!
Tell his worship&mdash;tell him the truth. It'll be best. I beg you tell him
the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> It's all no good. I know, I can feel, I'm done for. All that
I can do or say would be no use. Every word I do say turns against me.
The gentleman wants me to be guilty. I must be guilty, according to him.
So you see! What would you have me do, my poor darling? I've got no
strength to go on struggling against him. Let them do what they like
with me; I shan't say anything more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Yes, yes, you must speak. You must defend yourself. I beg of
you, Pierre. I beg of you, defend yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> What's the use?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> I beg you to in the name of your children. They don't know
anything yet&mdash;but they cry because they see me crying&mdash;because, you see,
I can't hide it, I can't control myself always in front of them. I can't
be cheerful, can I? And then they love me, so they notice it. And they
ask me questions, questions. If you only knew! They ask me about you.
Andr&eacute; was asking me again this morning, "Where's father? Are you going
to look for him? Tell me, are you going to fetch him?" I told him "yes"
and I ran away. You see you must defend yourself so as to get back to
them as soon as possible. If you've anything to reproach yourself with,
even the least thing, tell it. You are rough sometimes&mdash;so&mdash;I don't
know. But if you went to Irissary, you must say so. Perhaps you had a
quarrel with the poor old man. If that was it, say so, say so. Perhaps
you got fighting together and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> you&mdash;I'm saying perhaps you did&mdash;I don't
know&mdash;you understand&mdash;but his worship promised me just now that if it
was like that they wouldn't punish you&mdash;or not very much. My God, what
am I to say to you? What's to be done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> So you believe I'm guilty&mdash;you too! Tell me now! Do you
believe me guilty too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> I don't know! I don't know!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare</span> [<i>to Mouzon</i>] Ah, so you've managed that too; you've thought
of that too, to torture me through my wife&mdash;and it was you put it into
her head to speak to me about my children. I don't know what you can
have told her, but you've almost convinced her that I'm a scoundrel, and
you hoped she'd succeed in sending me to the guillotine in the name of
my children, because you know I worship them and they are everything to
me. You are right; I dare say there isn't another father living who
loves his little ones more than I love mine. [<i>To Yanetta</i>] You know
that, Yanetta! You know that! And you know too that with all my faults
I'm a true Christian, that I believe in God, in an almighty God. Well,
then, listen! My two boys&mdash;my little Georges, my little Andr&eacute;&mdash;I pray
God to kill them both if I'm a criminal!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta</span> [<i>with the greatest exultation</i>] He is innocent! I tell you he's
innocent! I tell you he's innocent! [<i>A pause</i>] Ah, now you can bring
your proofs, ten witnesses, a hundred if you like, and you might tell me
you saw him do it&mdash;I should tell you: It's not true! It's not true! You
might prove to me that he had confessed to it himself, and I would tell
you it wasn't true! Oh, you must feel it, your worship. You have a
heart&mdash;you know what it is when one loves one's children&mdash;so you must be
certain, you too, that he's innocent. You are going to give him back to
me, aren't you? It's settled now and you will give him back to me?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> If he is innocent, why did he lie just now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> It was you who lied&mdash;you! You told me you had witnesses who
saw me leave my house that night&mdash;and you hadn't anyone!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> If I had no one at that moment, I have someone now. Yes, there
is a witness who has declared that you were not at home on the night of
the crime, and that witness is your wife!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare</span> [<i>to Yanetta</i>] You!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>to the recorder</i>] Give me her interrogatory.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>While Mouzon looks through his papers Yanetta gazes for
some time at her husband, then at Mouzon. She is reflecting
deeply. Finally she seems to have made up her mind.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> There. Your wife has just told us that you left the house at ten
o'clock and did not return until five in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta</span> [<i>very plainly</i>] I did not say that. It is not true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> You went on to say that he returned alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> I did not say that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I will read your declaration. [<i>He reads</i>] Question: Then he
went out alone? Reply: Yes. Question: At ten o'clock? Reply: At ten
o'clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> I did not say that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Come, come! And I was careful to be precise. I said to you, "But
perhaps you are thinking of another night? It was really on the night of
Ascension Day that he went out alone?" And you replied, "Yes."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> It's not so!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> But I have it written here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> You can write whatever you like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Then I'm a liar. And the recorder too, he is a liar?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> The night old Goyetche was murdered my husband did not leave
the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> You will sign this paper, and at once. It is your interrogatory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> All that is untrue! I tell you it's untrue! [<i>Shouting</i>] The
night old Goyetche was murdered my husband never left the house&mdash;he
never left the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>pale with anger</i>] You will pay for this! [<i>To the recorder</i>]
Make out immediately an order for the detention of this woman and call
the gendarmes. [<i>To Yanetta</i>] Woman Etchepare, I place you under arrest
on a charge of being accessory to murder. [<i>To the gendarmes</i>] Take the
man to the cells and return for the woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Ah, you are angry, aren't you&mdash;furious&mdash;because you haven't got
your way! Although you've done everything, everything you possibly
could, short of killing us by inches! You pretend to be kind. You spoke
kindly to us. You wanted to make me send my husband to the scaffold!
[<i>Mouzon has taken up his brief and affects to be studying it with

must have criminals, guilty men, you must have them at any cost. When a
man falls into your clutches he's a dead man. They come in here innocent
and they've got to go out again guilty. It's your trade; it's a matter
of vanity with you to succeed! You ask questions which don't seem to
mean anything in particular, and yet they may send a man to the next
world; and when you've forced the poor wretch to condemn himself you're
delighted, like a savage would be!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>to the gendarmes</i>] Take her away&mdash;be quick!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Yes, a savage! You call that justice! [<i>To the gendarmes</i>] You
don't take me like that, I tell you! [<i>She clings to the furniture</i>]
You're a butcher! You are as cruel as the people in history who broke
one's bones to make one confess! [<i>The gendarmes have dragged her free;
she lets herself fall to the ground and shouts the rest of her speech

Your worship. It's too great an honor&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> Come, come, Monsieur Beno&icirc;t, shake hands with me. From
to-day I'm no longer a magistrate; my dignity no longer demands that I
shall be impolite to my inferiors. How far have they got with the
Etchepare trial?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> So far the hearing has been devoted entirely to the indictment

anxiety. She was there all yesterday afternoon and she came back to-day,
just as calm. Only to-day she wanted at any price to see the District
Attorney or one of his assistants. Monsieur Ardeuil is away and Monsieur

boy, Monsieur Claudet turned the waste water from his factory into the
brook that passes our house where we water the beasts. That was one of
the things that ruined us too. If Etchepare finds things like that when
he gets back, God knows what he'll do! I want the law to stop them doing
us all this harm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> The law! Ah, my good woman, it would be far better for you
to have nothing to do with the law.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Madame Etchepare.</span> But why? There is justice, and it's for everybody
alike.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> Of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Madame Etchepare.</span> Has Monsieur Claudet the right&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> Certainly not.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Madame Etchepare.</span> Then I want to ask the judge to stop him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> It is not so simple as you suppose, Madame. First of all you
must go to the bailiff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Madame Etchepare.</span> Good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> He will make a declaration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Madame Etchepare.</span> What about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> He will declare that your water supply is contaminated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Madame Etchepare.</span> There is no need to trouble a bailiff, sir. A
child could see that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> It is the law.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Madame Etchepare.</span> Well, and then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> Then you must go to a lawyer and get a judgment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Madame Etchepare.</span> Very well, if there 's no other way of doing it&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> That is not all. If Monsieur Claudet contests the facts, the
President will appoint an expert who will visit the site and make a
report. You will have to put in a request that the President will grant
a speedy hearing on grounds of urgency. Your case being finally put on
the list of causes, it would be heard in its turn&mdash;after the vacations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Madame Etchepare.</span> After the vacations!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> And that is not all. Monsieur Claudet's lawyer might
default, in which case judgment would be declared in your favor. But
Monsieur Claudet might defend the case, or enter some kind of plea and
obtain a judgment on that plea, or appeal against the judgment before
the matter would be finally settled. All this would cost a great deal of
money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Madame Etchepare.</span> Who would pay it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> You, naturally, and Monsieur Claudet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Madame Etchepare.</span> It's all one to him; he's rich; but for us, who
haven't a penny left!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> Then you would have to apply for judicial assistance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Madame Etchepare.</span> That would take still more time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> That would take much longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Madame Etchepare.</span> But, sir, I've always been told that justice was
free in France.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> Justice is gratuitous, but the means of obtaining access to
justice are not. That is all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Madame Etchepare.</span> And all that would take&mdash;how long?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> If Monsieur Claudet were to appeal, it might last two years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Madame Etchepare.</span> It isn't possible! Isn't the right on my side?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> My poor woman, it's not enough to have the right on your
side&mdash;you must have the law on your side too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Madame Etchepare.</span> I understand. Justice is a thing we poor people
can know only when it strikes us down. We can know it only by the harm
it does us. Well&mdash;we must go away&mdash;it doesn't matter where&mdash;and I shan't
regret it; people insult us; they call out to us as they pass. Etchepare
wouldn't put up with that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> In that respect the law protects you. Register a complaint
and those who insult you will be prosecuted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Madame Etchepare.</span> I don't think so. I have already registered a
complaint, as you say, but they've done nothing to the man who injured
us. So he goes on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> Is he an inhabitant of your commune?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Madame Etchepare.</span> Yes. A neighbor, a friend of Monsieur Mondoubleau,
the deputy. Labastide.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> Good. I will do what I can, I promise you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Madame Etchepare.</span> Thank you, sir. [<i>A pause</i>] Then I will go and
wait till they give me back my boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> That's right.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>She goes out slowly.</i></p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene III</span>:&mdash;<i>La Bouzole, recorder.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder</span> [<i>entering by the door at the back</i>] The hearing is suspended,
your worship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> Has Ma&icirc;tre Pla&ccedil;at concluded?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> With great applause. Two of the jurymen were seen wiping their
eyes. No one doubts there will be an acquittal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> So much the better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Your worship knows the great news?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> Which?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> That the Attorney-General has arrived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> No&mdash;I know nothing of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Yes, he has just arrived. It seems he brings the nomination of
one of these gentlemen to the post of Councillor in the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> Ah, ah! And whose is the prize, in your opinion, Beno&icirc;t?
Vagret's?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> That was my opinion. I hesitated a long time between him and
his Honor the President, and I decided it would be Monsieur Vagret. But
now I think I am wrong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> Do you think Monsieur Bunerat is appointed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> No, your worship. I feel very proud&mdash;I believe it is my
employer who has the honor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> Monsieur Mouzon!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Yes, your worship.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> What makes you think that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> His Honor the Attorney-General requested me to beg Monsieur
Mouzon to come and speak to him before the rising of the Court.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> My congratulations, my dear Monsieur Beno&icirc;t.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Madame Bunerat enters.</i></p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene IV</span>:&mdash;<i>The same and later Madame Vagret, Bunerat, the President of
Assizes, and Mouzon, then the Attorney-General.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bunerat</span> [<i>in tears</i>] Oh, my dear Monsieur La Bouzole!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> What has happened, Madame Bunerat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bunerat.</span> It's that advocate! What talent! What a heart! What
feeling! What genius! I feel quite shaken&mdash;quite upset&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> It's an acquittal?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bunerat.</span> They hope so&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret</span> [<i>entering</i>] Well, my dear Monsieur La Bouzole, you have
heard this famous advocate! What a ranter!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> It seems he has touched the jury. That means an acquittal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> I'm very much afraid it does.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Enter Bunerat in a black gown.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> Do you know what they tell me? The Attorney-General is here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bunerat.</span> Really!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Are you certain?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> It is true enough. He brings Monsieur Mouzon his appointment
to the Court of Appeal at Pau.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> Mouzon!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret and Madame Bunerat.</span> And my husband! We had a definite
promise!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The President of Assizes enters, wearing a red gown.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> Good-day, gentlemen. You have not seen the
Attorney-General, have you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> No, your honor&mdash;but if you will wait&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> No. Tell me, La Bouzole&mdash;you are an old stager&mdash;were you
in Court?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> From the balloting for the jurymen to the plea for the
defence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> Did you notice if I let anything pass that would make an
appeal to the Court of Cassation possible?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> I am sure you didn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> It's my constant fear&mdash;I am thinking of nothing else all
the time counsel are speaking. I always have the Manual of the President
of Assizes wide open in front of me; I'm always afraid, nevertheless, of
forgetting some formality. You see the effect of being in the
Chancellery&mdash;I never have a quiet conscience until the time-limit has
expired. [<i>A pause</i>] They tell me there were journalists here from
Toulouse and Bordeaux.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> And one from Paris.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> One from Paris! Are you sure?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> He was standing near the prisoner's bench.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> He was left to stand! A journalist from Paris and he was
left to stand! [<i>Catching sight of the recorder</i>] You knew that,
Monsieur the recorder, and you didn't warn me? Is that how you perform
your duties? Go at once and express my regret and find him a good seat;
do you hear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Yes, your honor. [<i>He turns to go</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President</span> [<i>running after him</i>] Here! [<i>Aside to the recorder</i>] Find
out if he's annoyed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Yes, your honor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> And then&mdash;[<i>He encounters Madame Bunerat at the door.
Pardon, Madame. He goes out, running, lifting up his gown</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Bouzole.</span> When I was at Montpellier I knew an old tenor who was as

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>haughtily</i>] Quite true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> They say he brings a councillor's appointment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> They say so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bunerat.</span> And you don't know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> You don't know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Nothing at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> Does nothing lead you to suppose&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder</span> [<i>entering</i>] Here is his Honor the Attorney-General.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> I am delighted, Monsieur the Councillor! [<i>Exit</i>]</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene V</span>:&mdash;<i>Mouzon, Attorney-General. Mouzon rubs his hands together,
bubbling with joy.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>obsequiously</i>] Your honor&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Sit down. [<i>Mouzon does so</i>] A report has come to my
office from Bordeaux&mdash;which concerns you, Monsieur! [<i>Feeling in his
portfolio</i>] Here it is. [<i>Reading</i>] Mouzon and the woman Pecquet. You
know what it is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>not taking the matter seriously, forces a smile. After a long
silence</i>] Yes, your honor&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> I am waiting for your explanation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>as before</i>] You have been young, your honor&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Not to that extent, Monsieur!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I admit I overstepped the mark a trifle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General</span> [<i>reading</i>] "Being in a state of intoxication, together
with the woman Pecquet and two other women of bad character who
accompanied him, the aforesaid Mouzon used insulting and outrageous
language to the police, whom he threatened with dismissal." Is that what
you call overstepping the mark a trifle?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Perhaps the expression is a little weak.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> And you allow the name of a magistrate to be coupled
in a police report with that of the woman Pecquet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> She told me her name was Diane de Montmorency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> [<i>continuing</i>] "Questioned by us, the commissary of
police, on the following morning, as to the rank of officer in the navy
which he had assumed"&mdash;[<i>The Attorney-General gazes at Mouzon. Another
pause</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon</span> [<i>still smiling</i>] Yes, it's on account of my whiskers, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Really?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> When I&mdash;oh, well&mdash;when I go to Bordeaux I always assume the rank
of naval officer, in order to safeguard the dignity of the law.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> You seem to have been a little tardy in considering
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I beg you to note, your honor, that I endeavored to safeguard it
from the very first, since I took care to go out of the arrondissement
and even the judicial division&mdash;in order to&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> I will continue. "Monsieur Mouzon then informed us of
his actual position as examining magistrate, and invoked that quality in
requesting that we would stop proceedings."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> The ass. He has put that in his report? Oh, really&mdash;that's due
to his lack of education. No, it's a political affair&mdash;the commissary is
one of our opponents&mdash;I asked him&mdash;After all&mdash;I wanted to avoid scandal.
Anyone would have done the same in my place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Is that the only explanation you have to give me?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Explanation? The truth is, Monsieur, that if you insist on
maintaining, in this conversation, the relations between a superior and
a subordinate, I can give you no further explanation. But if you would
be so good as to allow me for a moment to forget your position, if you
would agree to talk to me as man to man, I should tell you that this was
a fault of youth, regrettable, no doubt, but explained by the profound
boredom which exudes from the very paving-stones of Mauleon. Come, come!
I had dined too well. Every night of the year a host of decent fellows
find themselves in the same case. It's a pecadillo which doesn't affect
one's personal honor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Monsieur, when one has the honor to be a
magistrate&mdash;when one has accepted the mission of judging one's fellows,
one is bound more than all others to observe temperance and to consider
one's dignity in all things. What may not affect the honor of the
private citizen does affect the honor of the judge. You may take that
for granted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> As you refuse to discuss the matter otherwise than in an
official manner, nothing remains for me but to beg you to inform me what
you have decided to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Cannot you guess?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I am an examining magistrate. You will make me an ordinary
magistrate. It means my income will be diminished by five hundred francs
a year. I accept.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> It is unfortunately impossible for me to content
myself with such a simple measure. To speak plainly, I must inform you
that Monsieur Coire, the director of the newspaper which attacks us so
persistently, is acquainted with the whole of the facts of the
accusation brought against you and will not give his word not to publish
them unless by the end of the month you have left the Mauleon Court. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
therefore find myself in the unhappy necessity of demanding your
resignation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I shall not resign.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> You will not resign?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I am distressed to oppose any desire of yours, but I am quite
decided. I shall not resign.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> But really&mdash;you cannot know&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I know everything. <span class="smcap"> Attorney-General.</span> Very well, sir, we shall
proceed against you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Proceed. [<i>He rises</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Are you not alarmed at the scandal which would result
from your appearance in court and your probable conviction?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Conviction is less probable than you think. I shall be able to
defend myself and to select my advocate. As for the scandal, it wouldn't
fall on me. I am a bachelor, with no family; I know no one or next to no
one in Mauleon, where I am really in exile. My friends are all in
Bordeaux; they belong to the <i>monde ou l'on s'amuse</i>, and I should not
in the least lose caste in their eyes on account of such a prosecution.
You think I ought to leave the magistracy? Fortunately I have sufficient
to live on without the thirty-five hundred francs the Government of the
Republic allows me annually.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> That is enough, Monsieur. Good-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> My respects. [<i>He goes out</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doorkeeper.</span> Monsieur the deputy is here, your honor. Monsieur the deputy
says that your honor is waiting for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> That is so. Ask him to come in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Good-day, my dear Attorney-General.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Good-day, my dear deputy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> I'm delighted to see you. I've come from Paris. I had lunch
yesterday with my friend the Keeper of the Seals. The Government is
badly worried just at the moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> About what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> They're afraid of an interpellation. Just a chance&mdash;I'll
tell you about it. Tell me&mdash;it seems you have a young assistant here who
has been playing pranks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Monsieur Ardeuil?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Ardeuil, yes, that's the man. Eug&egrave;ne follows matters very
closely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Eug&egrave;ne?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Eug&egrave;ne&mdash;my friend Eug&egrave;ne&mdash;the Keeper of the Seals. He said
to me, "I expect your Attorney-General to understand how to do his
duty."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> I ask nothing better, but let me know what my duty is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> That's just what one wants to avoid. But look here, my
friend, you are a very mysterious person!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> You are asking for a change of appointment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Who told you that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Who do you suppose? He is the only one who knows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Eug&mdash;[<i>Quickly</i>] The Keeper of the Seals?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> You want to be appointed to Orl&eacute;ans? Am I correctly
informed?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Quite true. We have relations there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> I fancy you are concerned in the movement now in
preparation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Is there a movement in preparation?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> There is. As for Monsieur Ardeuil, the Minister confined
himself to saying that he had confidence in your firmness and zeal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> The Keeper of the Seals may rely on me. I shall have
to show considerable severity in several directions here, and I shall
lack neither determination nor zeal, I can assure you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Yes, but above all, tact! Eug&egrave;ne repeated a dozen times,
"Above all, no prosecutions, no scandals. At the present moment less
than ever. We are being watched. So everything must be done quietly."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> You needn't be alarmed. There's the matter of Mouzon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Mouzon! Mouzon the examining magistrate!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Of Mauleon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Precisely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> You aren't thinking of&mdash;One of my best friends&mdash;very well
disposed&mdash;a capital fellow&mdash;an excellent magistrate, full of energy and
discernment. I mentioned his name to Eug&egrave;ne in connection with the
vacant post of Councillor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> [<i>offering him the report</i>] You've picked the wrong
man. I am going to show you a document about him. Besides, the post is
promised to Monsieur Vagret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> What is wrong?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Here. I shall have to report<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span> him to the Superior
Council of the Magistracy or proceed against him in the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> What has he done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Read it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau</span> [<i>after casting a glance over the document which the other
has handed to him</i>] Of course. But really&mdash;there's nothing in that. If
you keep quiet about it, no one will know anything. No scandal. The
magistracy is suffering from too many attacks already just now, without
our providing our enemies with weapons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Unfortunately Coire knows of it, and he threatens to
tell the whole story in his paper unless Monsieur Mouzon is sent away
from Mauleon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> The devil! [<i>He begins to laugh</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> What are you laughing at?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Nothing&mdash;an extravagant idea, a jest. [<i>He laughs</i>] Tell
me&mdash;but you won't be annoyed?&mdash;it's only a joke&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> I was thinking&mdash;I tell you, it's a grotesque idea. But
after all&mdash;after all, if you propose Mouzon for the Councillor's chair
at Pau, you will be pleasing everyone!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> My dear deputy&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> A joke&mdash;of course, merely a joke&mdash;but what's so amusing
about it is that if you did so it would please Coire, it would please
me, it would please Mouzon, and it would please Eug&egrave;ne, who doesn't want
any scandal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> But it would be a&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> No, no. In politics there can be no scandal except where
there is publicity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> But really&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> I agree with you&mdash;I know all that could be said&mdash;I repeat,
I am only chaffing. And do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> you realize&mdash;it's very curious&mdash;when one
reflects&mdash;this fantastic solution is the only one that does not offer
serious disadvantages&mdash;obvious disadvantages. That is so. If you leave
Mouzon here, Coire tells everything. If you proceed against him, you
give a certain section of the press an opportunity it won't lose&mdash;an
opportunity of sapping one of the pillars of society. Those gentry are
not particular as to the means they employ. They will confound the whole
magistracy with Mouzon. It won't be Mouzon who will be the rake, but the
Court, the Court of Appeal. There will be mud on all&mdash;on every robe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> But you can't seriously ask me&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Do you know what we ought to do? Let us go and talk it over
with Rollet the senator&mdash;he is only a step from here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> I assure you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> Come&mdash;come. You will put in a word as to your going to
Orl&eacute;ans at the same time. What have you to risk? I tell you my solution
is the best. You will come to it, I assure you! I'll take you along.
[<i>He takes his arm</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Well, well, I had certainly something to say to
Rollet.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The doorkeeper enters.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Doorkeeper.</span> Not yet. Monsieur Vagret has been making a reply.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Is the jury in the withdrawing room?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doorkeeper.</span> No, your honor. They were going out when Monsieur Vagret
asked for an adjournment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mondoubleau.</span> What an idea! Really! Well, my friend, let us go. I tell
you, you'll come round!</p>

President of Assizes, Bunerat, Madame Bunerat, and Vagret.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder</span> [<i>much moved</i>] Admirable!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doorkeeper</span> [<i>half opening the door at the back</i>] Monsieur Beno&icirc;t! What's
the news?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Splendid! Our Prosecutor was admirable&mdash;and that Etchepare is
the lowest swine.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Enter Madame Vagret, greatly moved. The recorder goes up to
her. The doorkeeper disappears.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Ah! My God!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Madame Vagret, I am only a simple clerk, but allow me to say
it was admirable! Wonderful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Wonderful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> As for the counsel from Bordeaux, Monsieur Vagret had him
absolutely at his mercy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Hadn't he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> He's certain enough, now, to be condemned to death!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Certain!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Madame, the jurymen were looking at that fellow Etchepare,
that thug, in a way that made my blood run cold. As Monsieur Vagret went
on with his speech you felt they would have liked to settle his hash
themselves&mdash;the wretch!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> I saw that&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> I beg your pardon, Madame&mdash;I am forgetting myself&mdash;but there
are moments when one is thankful, yes, so gratified, that social
differences don't count.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> You are right, my dear man.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Enter the President of Assizes and Bunerat.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> Madame, I congratulate you! We've got it, the capital
sentence!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> We have it safely this time, haven't we, Monsieur?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> That is certain. But where is our hero? Magnificent&mdash;he
was magnificent&mdash;wasn't he, Bunerat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> Oh, sir, but the manner in which you presided prepared the way
so well&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> Well, well, I don't say I count for nothing in the
result, but we must do justice to Vagret. [<i>To Madame Vagret</i>] You ought
to be greatly gratified&mdash;very proud and happy, my dear Madame&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Oh, I am, your honor&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> But what a strange idea to demand an adjournment! Is he
unwell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Oh, dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> No. Here he is.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Enter Vagret. He is anxious.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Ah, my dear! [<i>She takes his hand in hers. She can say no
more, being choked by tears of joy</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> It was wonderful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> I can't restrain myself from congratulating you too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Really, you confuse me. The whole merit is yours, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> Not at all. Do you know what carried them all away? [<i>He
lights a cigarette</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> It was when you exclaimed, "Gentlemen of the jury, you
own houses, farms, and property; you have beloved wives, and daughters
whom you tenderly cherish. Beware&mdash;" You were splendid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span> there!
[<i>Resuming</i>] "Beware, if you leave such crimes unpunished; beware, if
you allow yourselves to be led astray by the eloquent sentimentality of
the defence; beware, I tell you, if you fail in your duty as the
instrument of justice; beware, lest those above you snatch up the sword
which has fallen from your feeble hands, when the blood that you have
not avenged will be spilt upon you and yours!" That was fine! Very fine!
And it produced a great effect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> But you, my dear President, you moved them even more noticeably
when you recalled the fact, very appropriately, that the accused loved
the sight of blood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> Ah, yes, that told a little!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span> What? What was that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> The President put this question: "On the morning of the crime
did you not slaughter two sheep?" "Yes," replied the accused. And then,
looking him straight in the eyes&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> Yes, I asked him: "You were getting into practice,
weren't you?" [<i>To Vagret</i>] But after all, if I have to a certain extent
affected the result, the greater part of the honor of the day is yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> You are too kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> Not at all! And your peroration! [<i>With an artist's
curiosity</i>] You were really, were you not, under the stress of a great
emotion, a really great emotion?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret</span> [<i>gravely</i>] Yes, I was under the stress of a great emotion, a
really great emotion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> You turned quite pale when you faced the jury&mdash;when you
added, in a clear voice, "Gentlemen, I demand the head of this man!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret</span> [<i>his eyes fixed</i>] Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> Then you made a sign to the advocate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Yes. I thought he would have something else to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> But why delay the verdict? You had won the victory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Precisely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> During my indictment a fact came to light that worried me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> A fact?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Not a fact&mdash;but&mdash;in short&mdash;[<i>A pause</i>] I beg your pardon&mdash;I am
very tired&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> I can very well understand your emotion, my dear Vagret.
One always feels&mdash;on the occasion of one's first death
sentence&mdash;but&mdash;you will see one gets used to it. [<i>Going out, to
Bunerat</i>] Indeed, he does look very tired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> I fancy he is feeling his position too keenly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> As I was leaving the Court I met the Attorney-General. I begged
him urgently to give me a moment's conversation. I wanted to speak with
him alone&mdash;and with you, Monsieur le Pr&eacute;sident.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> As you wish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> I am afraid you are unwell, my dear. I shall wait there.
I will come back directly these gentlemen have gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Very well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bunerat</span> [<i>going out, to her husband</i>] There's a man ready to do
something stupid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> That doesn't concern us.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Scene VIII</span>:&mdash;<i>Vagret, the President of Assizes, then the
Attorney-General.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> Did you notice any mistake on my part in the direction of
the case?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> No, if any mistake was made, it was I who made it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Attorney-General enters.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> What is this that is so serious, my dear sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> It's this&mdash;I am more worried than I can say. I want to appeal to
the conscience of you two gentlemen&mdash;to reassure myself&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Tell us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> A whole series of facts&mdash;the attitude of the accused&mdash;certain
details which had escaped me&mdash;have given rise, in my mind, to a doubt as
to the guilt of this man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Was there any mention of these facts, these details,
in the brief?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Had the advocate studied this brief?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Naturally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Well, then? What are you worrying yourself about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> But&mdash;suppose the man is not guilty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> The jury will decide. We can do no more, all of us,
than bow to its verdict.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Let me tell you, sir, how my convictions have been shaken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> I do not wish to know. All that is a matter between
yourself and your conscience. You have the right to explain your
scruples to the jury. You know the proverb: "The pen is a slave, but
speech is free."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> I shall follow your advice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> I do not give you any advice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> I shall explain my doubts to the jury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> It will mean acquittal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> What would you have?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Do as you wish; but I should like to tell you one
thing. When a man plans a startling trick of this kind and has the
courage to accomplish it entirely of his own accord, he must have the
courage to accept the sole responsibility of the blunders he may commit.
You are too clever; you want to discover some means by which you need
not be the only one to suffer from the consequences of your
vacillations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Clever? I? How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Come, come! We are not children, and I can perfectly
well see the trap into which you have lured me. You are sheltering
yourself behind me. If the Chancellery should complain of your attitude,
you will say that you consulted your superior, and I shall be the
victim. And then I shall have a quarrel with the Chancellery on my
hands. You don't care, you don't think of my position or my interests,
of which you know nothing. Some silly idea gets into your head, and
against my will you want to make me responsible for it. I say again, it
is extremely clever, and I congratulate you, but I don't thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> You have misunderstood me, sir. I have no wish to burden you
with the responsibilities I am about to assume. I should hardly choose
the moment when I am on the point of being appointed Councillor to
perpetrate such a blunder. I told you of my perplexity, and I asked your
advice. That was all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> Are you certain one way or the other?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> If I were certain, should I ask advice? [<i>A pause</i>] If we only
had a cause for cassation, a good&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President</span> [<i>enraged</i>] What's that you say? Cause for cassation?
Based on an error or on an oversight on my part, no doubt! Really, you
have plenty of imagination! You are attacked by certain doubts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span> certain
scruples&mdash;I don't know what&mdash;and in order to quiet your morbidly
distracted conscience you ask me kindly to make myself the culprit!
Convenient, in truth, to foist on others who have done their duty the
blunders one may have committed oneself!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General</span> [<i>quietly</i>] It is indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> And at the Chancellery, when they mention me, they'll
say, "Whatever sort of a councillor is this, who hasn't even the
capacity to preside over an Assize Court at Mauleon!" A man whom we've
taken such trouble to get condemned! And to make me, me, the victim of
such trickery! No, no! Think of another way, my dear Monsieur; you won't
employ that, I can assure you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Then I shall seek other means; but I shall not leave matters in
their present state.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General.</span> Do what you like, but realize that I have given you no
advice in one direction or another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> I realize that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> When you have decided to resume the hearing you will
notify us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> I will notify you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attorney-General</span> [<i>to the President</i>] Let us go.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Scene IX</span>:&mdash;<i>Vagret, Madame Vagret.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Nothing? You are so depressed&mdash;and yet you've just had
such a success as will tell on your career.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> It is that success which alarms me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Alarms you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Yes, I'm afraid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Afraid of what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Of having gone too far.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Too far! Doesn't the murderer deserve death ten times
over?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret</span> [<i>after a pause</i>] Are you quite certain, yourself, that he is a
murderer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret</span> [<i>in a low voice</i>] Well&mdash;for myself&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> You?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> I&mdash;I don't know. I know nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> My God!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> A dreadful thing happened to me in the course of my indictment.
While I, the State Attorney, the official prosecutor, was exercising my
function, another self was examining the case calmly, in cold blood; an
inner voice kept reproaching me for my violence and insinuating into my
mind a doubt, which has gone on increasing. A painful struggle has been
going on in my mind, a cruel struggle&mdash;and if, as I was finishing, I
labored under that emotion of which the President was speaking, if when
I demanded the death penalty my voice was scarcely audible, it was
because I was at the end of my struggle; because my conscience was on
the point of winning the battle, and I made haste to finish, because I
was afraid it would speak out against my will. When I saw the advocate
remain seated and that he was not going to resume his speech in order to
tell the jury the things I would have had him tell them&mdash;then I was
really afraid of myself, afraid of my actions, of my words, of their
terrible consequences, and I wanted to gain time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> But, my dear, you have done your duty; if the advocate
has not done his, that does not concern you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Always the same reply. If I were an honest man I should tell the
jury, when the hearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span> is resumed, of the doubts that have seized me. I
should explain how those doubts arose in me; I should call their
attention to a point which I deliberately concealed from them, because I
believed the counsel for the defence would point it out to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> You know, my dear, how thoroughly I respect your
scruples, but allow me to tell you all the same that it won't be you who
will declare Etchepare guilty or not guilty; it will be the jury. If
anyone ought to feel disturbed, it is Ma&icirc;tre Pla&ccedil;at, not you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> But I ought to represent justice!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Here is a prisoner who comes before you with previous
convictions, with a whole crushing series of circumstances establishing
his guilt. He is defended by whom? By one of the ornaments of the Bar, a
man famed for his conscience as much as for his ability and his
oratorical skill. You expound the facts to the jury. If the jury agrees
with you, I cannot see that your responsibility as a magistrate is
involved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> I don't think about my responsibility as a magistrate&mdash;but my
responsibility as a man is certainly involved! No! No! I have not the
right. I tell you there is a series of circumstances in this case of
which no one has spoken and the nature of which makes me believe in the
innocence of the accused.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> But&mdash;these circumstances&mdash;how was it you knew nothing of
them until now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret</span> [<i>his head drooping</i>] Do you think I did know nothing of them? My
God! Shall I have the courage to tell you everything? I am not a bad
man, am I? I wouldn't wish anyone to suffer for a fault of
mine&mdash;but&mdash;oh, I am ashamed to admit it, to say it aloud, even, when I
have admitted it to myself! Well, when I was studying the brief, I had
got it so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span> firmly fixed in my mind, to begin with, that Etchepare was a
criminal, that when an argument in his favor presented itself to my
mind, I rejected it utterly, shrugging my shoulders. As for the facts of
which I am speaking, and which gave rise to my doubts&mdash;at first I simply
tried to prove that those facts were false, taking, from the depositions
of the witnesses, only that which would militate against their truth and
rejecting all the rest, with a terrible simplicity of bad faith. And in
the end, in order to dissipate my last scruples, I told myself, just as
you told me, "That is the business of the defence; it isn't mine!"
Listen, and you'll see to what point the exercise of the magistrate's
office distorts our natures, makes us unjust and cruel. At first I had a
feeling of delight when I saw that the President, in his
cross-examination, was throwing no light whatever on this series of
little facts. It was my profession speaking in me, my profession, do you
see? Oh, what poor creatures we are, what poor creatures!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Perhaps the jury won't find him guilty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> It will find him guilty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Or it may find there are extenuating circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> No. I adjured them too earnestly to refuse to do so. I was
zealous enough, wasn't I? Violent enough?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> That's true. Why did you make your indictment so
passionately?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Ah, why, why? Long before the hearing of the case it was so
clearly understood by everybody that the prisoner was the criminal! And
then it all went to my head, it intoxicated me&mdash;the way they talked. I
was the spokesman of humanity, I was to reassure the countryside, I was
to restore tranquillity to the family, and I don't know what else! So
then&mdash;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span> felt I must show myself equal to the part intrusted to me. My
first indictment was relatively moderate&mdash;but when I saw the celebrated
counsel making the jurymen weep, I thought I was lost; I felt the
verdict would escape me. Contrary to my habit, I replied. When I rose to
my feet for the second time I was like a man fighting, who has just had
a vision of defeat, and who therefore fights with the strength of
despair. From that moment Etchepare, so to speak, no longer existed. I
was no longer concerned to defend society or sustain my accusation; I
was contending against the advocate; it was a trial of orators, a
competition of actors; I had to be the victor at all costs. I had to
convince the jury, resume my hold on it, wring from it the double "yes"
of the verdict. I tell you, Etchepare no longer counted; it was I who
counted, my vanity, my reputation, my honor, my future. It's shameful, I
tell you, shameful. At any cost I wanted to prevent the acquittal which
I felt was certain. And I was so afraid of not succeeding that I
employed every argument, good and bad, even that of representing to the
terrified jurymen their own houses in flames, their own flesh and blood
murdered. I spoke of the vengeance of God falling on judges without
severity. And all this in good faith&mdash;or rather unconsciously, in a
burst of passion, in an access of anger against the advocate, whom I
hated at that moment with all my might. My success was greater than I
hoped; the jury is ready to obey me; and I, my dear, I have allowed
myself to be congratulated, I have grasped the hands held out to me.
That is what it is to be a magistrate!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vagret.</span> Never mind. Perhaps there aren't ten in all France who
would have acted otherwise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> You are right. Only&mdash;if one reflects&mdash;it's precisely that that's
so dreadful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<h2>ACT IV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Scenes</span>&mdash;<i>Same as the Second Act.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene I</span>:-<i>Bunerat, the President of Assizes, and Vagret.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> Well, your honor, there's another session finished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President</span> [<i>in red robe</i>] I've been in a blue funk lest these brutes
would make me lose my train. I'm going shooting to-morrow on the Cambo
Ponds, you see, my dear fellow, and after to-night's train it's no go.
[<i>Looks at his watch</i>] Oh, I've an hour and a half yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> And what do you think of it, your honor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> Of what? Of the acquittal? What does it matter to me? I
don't care&mdash;on the contrary, I prefer it. I am certain the advocate
won't ferret out some unintentional defect&mdash;some formality gone wrong.
Where's my hat-box?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>He is about to stand on a chair to reach the hat-box, which
is on the top of a cupboard. Bunerat precedes him.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> Permit me, Monsieur. You are at home here. [<i>From the chair</i>] I
believe I shall have the pleasure of seeing you here again next session.
[<i>He sighs, holding out the hat-box</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> A pleasure I shall share, my dear fellow. [<i>He takes out
a small felt hat from the box</i>]<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> Would you like a brush? There's Mouzon's brush. [<i>A sigh</i>] Ah,
good God, when shall I leave Mauleon? I should so like to live at Pau!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> Pooh! A much overrated city! Come, come!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> I suppose my new duties won't take me there yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> Don't you worry yourself. In the winter, yes, it's very
well&mdash;but the summer&mdash;ah, the summer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> I am not the one appointed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> Ah! You know already?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> Yes&mdash;I&mdash;yes&mdash;that is to say, I didn't know it was official.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President</span> [<i>brushing his hat and catching sight of a dent</i>] Dented
already. In these days the hats they sell you for felt, my dear chap,
they're paste-board, simply&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> True. Yes, I didn't know it was official. Monsieur Mouzon is
very lucky.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Enter Vagret in mufti.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> There, there is our dear Monsieur Vagret. Changed your
dress already. Yes, you're at home, you. For my part I must pack up all
this. Where the devil is the box I put my gown in? [<i>Bunerat makes a
step to fetch it and then remains motionless</i>] It's curious&mdash;that&mdash;what
have they done with it? In that cupboard&mdash;you haven't seen it, my dear
Monsieur Bunerat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> Ah, here it is&mdash;and my jacket in it. [<i>He opens the box
and takes out his jacket, which he lays aside on the table</i>] Well, well,
you've got them acquitted, my dear sir! Are you satisfied?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> I am very glad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> And if they are the murderers?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> I must console myself with Berryer's remark: "It is better to
leave ten guilty men at liberty than to punish one innocent man."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> You have a sensitive nature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Ought one to have a heart of stone, then, to be a magistrate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President</span> [<i>tying up the box in which he has put his judge's
bonnet</i>] One must keep oneself above the little miseries of humanity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Above the miseries of others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> Hang it all&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> That is what we call egoism.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> Do you say that for my benefit?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> For all three of us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunerat.</span> Au revoir, gentlemen. Au revoir. [<i>He shakes hands with each
and goes out</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President</span> [<i>taking off his gown</i>] My dear Monsieur, I beg you to be
more moderate in your remarks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Ah, I assure you that I am moderate! If I were to speak what is
in my mind, you would hear very unpleasant things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President</span> [<i>in shirt sleeves</i>] Are you forgetting to whom you are
speaking? I am a Councillor of the Court, Monsieur le Procureur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Once again, I am not speaking to you merely; the disagreeable
things I might say would condemn me equally. I am thinking of those poor
people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President</span> [<i>brushing his gown</i>] What poor people? The late
prisoners? But after all, they are acquitted. What more do you want? To
provide them with an income?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> They are acquitted, true; but they are condemned, all the same.
They are sentenced to misery for life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> What are you talking about?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> And through your fault, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President</span> [<i>stopping in his task of folding his gown</i>] My fault!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> And what is so particularly serious is that you didn't know it,
you didn't see, you haven't seen the harm you did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> What harm? I have done no harm! I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> When you informed Etchepare that his wife had long ago been
condemned for receiving stolen goods, and that she had been seduced
before his marriage with her. When you did that you did a wicked thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> You are a Don Quixote. Do you suppose Etchepare didn't
know all that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> If you had noticed his emotion when his wife, on your asking her
if the facts were correct, replied that they were, you would be certain,
as I am, that he knew nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President</span> [<i>packing his gown in its box</i>] Well, even so! You
attribute to people of that sort susceptibilities which they don't
possess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Your honor, "people of that sort" have hearts, just as you and I
have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> Admitted. Didn't my duty force me to do as I did?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> I know nothing about that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President</span> [<i>still in shirt sleeves</i>] It's the law that is guilty,
then, eh? Yes? Well, Monsieur, if I did my duty&mdash;and I did&mdash;you are
lacking in your duty in attacking the law, whose faithful servant you
should be, the law which I, for one, am proud to represent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> There's no reason for your pride.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> Monsieur!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> It's a monstrous thing, I tell you, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span> one can reproach an
accused person, whether innocent or guilty, with a fault committed ten
years ago, and which has been expiated. Yes, Monsieur, it is a horrible
thing that, after punishing, the law does not pardon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President</span> [<i>who has put on his jacket and hat</i>] If you think the law
is bad, get it altered. Enter Parliament.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Alas, if I were a deputy, it is probable that I should be like
the rest; instead of thinking of such matters I should think of nothing
but calculating the probable duration of the Government.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President</span> [<i>his box under his arm</i>] In that case&mdash;is the
doorkeeper&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret</span> [<i>touching a bell</i>] He will come. Then it's Monsieur Mouzon who
is appointed in my place?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> It is Monsieur Mouzon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Because he's the creature of a deputy, a Mondoubleau&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> I cannot allow you to speak ill of Monsieur
Mondoubleau&mdash;before my face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> You think you may perhaps have need of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> Precisely. [<i>The doorkeeper appears</i>] Will you carry that
to my hotel for me? The hotel by the station. You will easily recognize
it; my sentry is at the door. [<i>He hands the doorkeeper his boxes</i>] Au
revoir, my dear Vagret&mdash;no offence taken.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>He goes. Vagret puts on his hat and also makes ready to go.
Enter recorder and Etchepare.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Recorder.</span> You are going, your honor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Recorder.</span> You won't have any objection, then, if I bring Etchepare
in here? He's in the corridor, waiting for the formalities of his
release&mdash;and he complains he's an object of curiosity to everyone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Of course!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Recorder.</span> I'll tell them to bring his wife here too when she leaves
the record office.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Very well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Recorder.</span> I am just going to warn the warders&mdash;but the woman
Etchepare can't be released immediately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Recorder.</span> She's detained in connection with another case. She's
charged with abusing a magistrate in the exercise of his duty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Is that magistrate Monsieur Mouzon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Recorder.</span> Yes, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> I will try to arrange that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Recorder.</span> Good-day, your honor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vagret.</span> Good-day.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene II.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The Recorder</span> [<i>at the door</i>] Etchepare&mdash;come in. You had better wait
here for your final discharge. It won't take much longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> Thank you, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Recorder.</span> Well, there you are, then, acquitted, my poor fellow!
There's one matter done with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> It's finished as far as justice is concerned, Monsieur; it
isn't finished for me. I'm acquitted, it's true, but my life is made
miserable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Recorder.</span> You didn't know&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> That's it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Recorder.</span> It's a long time ago&mdash;you'll forgive her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> Things like that, Monsieur&mdash;a Basque never forgives them.
It's as though a thunderbolt had struck me to the heart. And all the
misfortune that's befallen us&mdash;it's she who is the cause&mdash;God has
avenged himself. Everything's over.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Recorder</span> [<i>after a pause</i>] I am sorry for you with all my heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> Thank you, Monsieur. [<i>A pause</i>] Since you are so kind,
Monsieur, will you allow my mother, who's there in the corridor, waiting
for me, to come and speak to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Recorder.</span> I'll send her in to you. Good-bye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> Good-bye.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene III</span>:&mdash;<i>The recorder goes out. Enter Etchepare's mother.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare</span> [<i>pressing his mother's head against his breast</i>] Poor old
mother&mdash;how the misery of these three months has changed you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Mother.</span> My poor boy, how you must have suffered!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> That woman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Mother.</span> Yes, they've just been telling me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> For ten years I've lived with that thief&mdash;that wretched
woman! How she lied! Ah! When I heard that judge say to her, "You were
convicted of theft and complicity with your lover," and when, before all
those people, she owned to it&mdash;I tell you, mummy, I thought the skies
were falling on my head&mdash;and when she admitted she'd been that man's
mistress&mdash;I don't know just what happened&mdash;nor which I would have killed
soonest&mdash;the judge who said such things so calmly or her who admitted
them with her back turned to me. And then I was on the point of
confessing myself guilty&mdash;I, an innocent man&mdash;in order not to learn any
more&mdash;to get away&mdash;but I thought of you and the children! [<i>A long
pause</i>] Come! We've got to make up our minds what we're going to do. You
left them at home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Mother.</span> No. I had to send them to our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span> cousin at Bayonne. We've no
longer got a home&mdash;we've nothing&mdash;we are ruined. Besides, I've got a
horror of this place now. The women edge away and make signs to one
another when I meet them, and in the church they leave me all alone in
the middle of an empty space. Already&mdash;I had to take the children away
from school.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> My God!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Mother.</span> No one would speak to them. One day Georges picked a quarrel
with the biggest, and they fought, and as Georges got the better of it,
the other, to revenge himself, called him the son of a gallows-bird.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> And Georges?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Mother.</span> He came home crying and wouldn't go out of doors. It was
then that I sent them away to Bayonne.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> That's what we'll do. Go away. We'll go and fetch them.
To-morrow or to-night I shall be with you again. There are emigration
companies there&mdash;boats to America&mdash;they'll send all four of us&mdash;they'll
give us credit for the voyage on account of the children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Mother.</span> And when they ask for their mother&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare</span> [<i>after a pause</i>] You'll tell them she's dead.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene IV</span>:&mdash;<i>Yanetta is shown in.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta</span> [<i>to someone outside</i>] Very good, Monsieur. [<i>The door is
closed</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Mother</span> [<i>without looking at Yanetta</i>] Then I'll go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare</span> [<i>the same</i>] Yes. I shall see you again to-night or down there
to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Mother.</span> Very well.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> Directly you get there you'll go and find out about the day
and hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Mother.</span> Very well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> Till to-morrow then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Mother.</span> To-morrow. [<i>She goes out without glancing at Yanetta</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta</span> [<i>takes a few steps towards her husband, falls on her knees, and
clasps her hands. In a low voice</i>] Forgive me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> Never!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Don't say never!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> Was the judge lying?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> No&mdash;he wasn't lying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> You wretched thing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Yes, I am a wretched thing! Forgive me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> Kill you rather! I could kill you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Yes, yes! But forgive me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> You're just a loose woman&mdash;a loose woman from Paris, with no
honor, no shame, no honesty even!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Yes! Insult me&mdash;strike me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> For ten years you have been lying to me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Oh, how I wished I could have told you everything! Oh, how many
times I began that dreadful confession! I never had courage enough. I
was always afraid of your anger, Pierre, and of the pain I should cause
you&mdash;I saw you were so happy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> You came from up there, fresh from your vice, fresh from
prison, and you chose me to be your gull.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> My God, to think he believes that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> You brought me the leavings of a swindler&mdash;the leavings of a
swindler&mdash;and you stole,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span> in my house, the place of an honest woman!
Your lies have brought the curse of God on my family and it's you who
are the cause of everything. The misfortune that's just befallen us,
it's you who are the cause of it, I tell you! You're a pest, accursed,
damned! Don't say another word to me! Don't speak to me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Have you no pity, Pierre? Do you suppose I'm not suffering?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> If you are suffering you've deserved it! You haven't suffered
enough yet. But what had I ever done to you that you should choose me
for your victim? What did I ever do that I should have to bear what I'm
suffering? You've made me a coward&mdash;you've lowered me almost to your own
level&mdash;I ought to have been able to put you out of my mind and my heart
already! And I can't! And I'm suffering torture, terrible torture&mdash;for
I'm suffering through the love I once had for you. You&mdash;you were
everything to me for ten years&mdash;my whole life. You've been everything,
everything! And now the one hope left me is that I may forget you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Oh, forgive me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> Never! Never!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Don't say that word&mdash;only God has the right to say&mdash;never! I
will come back to you. I'll be only like the head servant&mdash;no, the
lowest if you like! I won't take my place in the home again until you
tell me to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> We have no house; we have no home. Nothing is left now! And I
tell you again it's your fault&mdash;and it's because you used to be there,
in the mother's place, my mother's place, you, a lie and a
sacrilege&mdash;it's because of that that misfortune has overtaken us!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> I swear to you I'd make you forget it all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span> in time&mdash;I'd be so
humble, so devoted, so repentant. And wherever you go I shall follow
you. Pierre&mdash;think, your children still need me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> My children! You shall never see them again! You shall never
speak to them. I won't have you kiss them. I won't have you even touch
them!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta</span> [<i>changing her tone</i>] Ah, no, not that, not that! The children!
No, you are wrong there! You can deprive me of everything&mdash;you can put
every imaginable shame upon me&mdash;you can force me to beg my bread&mdash;I'll
do it willingly. You needn't look at me&mdash;you needn't speak to me except
to abuse me&mdash;you can do anything, anything you like. But my children, my
children&mdash;they are mine, the fruit of my body&mdash;they are still part of
me&mdash;they are blood of my blood and bone of my bone forever. You might
cut off one of my arms, and my arm would be a dead thing, and no part of
myself any more, but you can't stop my children being my children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> You have made yourself unworthy to keep them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Unworthy! What has unworthiness to do with it? Have I ever
failed in my duty to them? Have I been a bad mother? Answer me! I
haven't, have I? Well then, if I haven't been a bad mother, my rights
over them are as great as ever they were! Unworthy! I might be a
thousand times more guilty&mdash;more unworthy, as you call it&mdash;but neither
you, nor the law, nor the priests, nor God himself would have the right
to take them from me. I have been to blame as a wife, it's possible, but
as a mother I've nothing to reproach myself with. Well then&mdash;well
then&mdash;no one can steal them from me! And you, who could think of such a
thing, you're a wretch! Yes, it's to avenge yourself that you want to
part me from them! You're just a coward! Just a man! There's no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
fatherhood left in your heart&mdash;you don't think of them. Yes&mdash;you are
lying&mdash;I tell you, you are lying! When you say I'm not worthy to bring
them up you're lying! It's only a saying&mdash;only words. You know it isn't
true&mdash;you know I've nourished them, cared for them, loved them, consoled
them, and I have taught them to say their prayers every night, and I
would go on doing so. You know that no other woman will ever fill my
place&mdash;but that makes no difference to you. You forget them&mdash;you want to
punish me, so you want to take them from me. I'm justified in saying to
you that it's an act of cowardly wickedness and a vile piece of
vengeance! Ah! The children! You want to gamble with them now. No&mdash;to
take them away from me&mdash;think, Pierre, think; it isn't possible, what
you are saying!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> You are right; I am revenging myself! What you think an
impossibility is done already. My mother has taken the children and gone
away with them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> I shall find them again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> America is a big country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> I shall find them again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> Then I shall tell them why I have taken them away from you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Never! Never that! I'll obey you, but swear&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The recorder enters.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Recorder.</span> Etchepare, come and sign your discharge. You will be
released at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Wait a moment, Monsieur, wait a moment. [<i>To Etchepare</i>] I
agree to separation if I must. I will disappear&mdash;you will never hear of
me again. But in return for this wicked sacrifice swear solemnly that
you will never tell them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> I swear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> You swear never to tell them anything that may lessen their
affection for me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> I swear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Promise me too&mdash;I beg you, Pierre&mdash;in the name of our happiness
and my misery&mdash;promise to keep me fresh in their memory&mdash;let them pray
for me, won't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> I swear it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Then go&mdash;my life is done with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etchepare.</span> Good-bye.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>He goes out with the recorder. At the door the latter meets
Mouzon.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Recorder</span> [<i>to Etchepare</i>] They are coming to show you the way out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Recorder</span> [<i>to Mouzon</i>] The woman Etchepare is there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Ah, she's there. Monsieur Vagret has been speaking of her. Well,
I withdraw my complaint; I ask nothing better than that she shall be set
at liberty. Now that I am a Councillor I don't want to be coming back
from Pau every week for the examination. Proceed with the necessary
formalities.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene V</span>:&mdash;<i>Mouzon, Yanetta, the recorder.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Well&mdash;in consideration of the time you have been in custody, I
am willing that you should be set at liberty&mdash;provisional liberty. I
may, perhaps, even withdraw my complaint if you express regret for
having insulted me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta</span> [<i>calmly</i>] I do not regret having insulted you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Do you want to go back to prison?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> My poor man, if you only knew how little it matters to me
whether I go to prison or not!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Why?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Because I have nothing left, neither house, nor home, nor
husband, nor children. [<i>She looks at him</i>] And&mdash;I think&mdash;I think&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> You think?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> I think it is you who are the cause of all the trouble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> You are both acquitted, aren't you? What more do you ask?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> We have been acquitted, it is true. But all the same, I am no
longer an honest woman&mdash;neither to my husband, nor to my children, nor
to the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> If anyone reproaches you with the penalty inflicted upon you
formerly, if anyone makes any illusion to the time you have spent in
custody under remand, you have the right to prosecute the offender in
the courts. He will be punished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Well! It is because someone reproached me with that old
conviction that my husband has taken my children from me. That someone
is a magistrate. Can I have him punished?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Why not? Because he is a magistrate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> No. Because he is the law.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> The law! [<i>Violently</i>] Then the law is wicked, wicked!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> Come, no shouting, no insults, please. [<i>To the recorder</i>] Have
you finished? Then go to the office and have an order made out for her
discharge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> I'm no scholar; I've not studied the law in books, like you,
and perhaps for that very reason I know better than you what is just and
what is not. And I want to ask you a plain question: How is the law
going to give me back my children and make up to me for the harm it's
done me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> The law owes you nothing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> The law owes me nothing! Then what are you going to do&mdash;you,
the judge?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> A magistrate is not responsible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Ah, you are not responsible! So you can arrest people just as
you like, just when you fancy, on a suspicion or even without a
suspicion; you can bring shame and dishonor on their families; you can
torture the unhappy, ferret into their past lives, expose their
misfortunes, dig up forgotten offences, offences which have been atoned
for and which go back to ten years ago; you can make use of your skill,
your tricks and lies, and your cruelty to send a man to the foot of the
scaffold, and worse still, you can drive people into taking a mother's
children away from her&mdash;and after that you say, like Pontius Pilate,
that you aren't responsible! Not responsible! Perhaps you aren't
responsible in the eyes of this law of yours, since you tell me you
aren't, but in the eyes of pure and simple justice, the justice of
decent people, the justice of God, before that I swear you are
responsible, and that is why I am going to call you to account!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>She sees on Mouzon's desk the dagger which he uses as a
paper-knife. He turns his back on her. She seizes the knife
and puts it down again.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I order you to get out of here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> Listen to me. For the last time I ask you&mdash;what do you think
you can do to make up to me&mdash;to give me back all I've lost through your
fault; what are you going to do to lessen my misery, and how do you
propose to give me back my children?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouzon.</span> I have nothing to say to you. I owe you nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yanetta.</span> You owe me nothing! You owe me more than life&mdash;more than
everything. My children I shall never see again. What you've taken from
me is the happiness of every moment of the day&mdash;their kisses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span> at
night&mdash;the pride I felt in watching them grow up. Never, never again
shall I hear them call me "mother." It's as though they were dead&mdash;it's
as though you had killed them. [<i>She seizes the knife</i>] Yes! That's your
work; it's you bad judges have done it; you have nearly made a criminal
of an innocent man, and you force an honest woman, a mother&mdash;to become a
criminal!</p>
